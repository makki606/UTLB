# INFO DUMP

SKIP
I want to turn this story into a visual novel cuz it has been my dream to create one for ages, I guess like ever since 2017???

I think it all started after I watched Amnesia (anime) and found out it was adapted from a vn game. At that time I already wrote my own stories.

so there will be 3 endings like in Cytus II (game)

1) bad ending, seleni dies and or’ath whatever
2) good ending, seleni and or’ath manage to solve their problems and everyone’s happy by the end.
3) true ending, seleni and or’ath manage to solve their problems, with some realistic consequences and some downsides.
4) Bad ending will be kinda tragic for or’ath. He will be forced to eat her soul because she makes a deal with his father and he didn’t want her soul and heart to be devoured by him, so he does it instead and creates a pretty grave for her inside the greenhouse which he takes it for him and becomes the new owner of Sheep Pharm carrying on her legacy.
Seleni and or’ath romance will be optional, depending on choices and they can happen in all endings. 
I'm still stuck on how to fit aadien and lilith’s backstory in this

seleni was born in gallserin which was, about a thousand years ago, the place where fhaerta lived as the chief’s personal slave. The chief was a warlock patronized by or’aath I. He was a tyrant and taxed the villagers highly, treating them poorly and doing basically whatever he wanted. He had a group of cultists who supported him there. The day after they sacrificed fhaerta to the devil was the day everything changed. One of the villagers witnessed fhaerta coming out of his house and the next day he was found dead so they all assumed she killed him and disappeared like a ghost. All the cultists fled, a new chief was chosen and fhaerta became a saviour figure and was celebrated by the village ever since

Seleni grew up hearing the story of fhaerta and admired the woman. She was the next in line chief of the village. Ever since young, she had to study hard to become a chief. She had arrow and bow practice, politics study, writing lessons, read books and practice ceremonial dances. She didn’t enjoy doing all of that because there was no time to play and she had no friends either. 

When she reached maturity, she became the new chief and was tattooed the chief crest on her spine.

She ruled a little, but her true dream was to live in the city. She loved hearing stories of wanderers and people who passed by. She wanted to explore the world and meet all kinds of people. That’s when she decided to leave, leaving her position to Evion (Lael), her closest childhood friend

She sailed off far away. 

She enrolled in a pharmacy school where she studied a lot but she sank in student debt. She used to live in a sharehouse and made a living by attending and healing sick people at the house. Her other housemates didn’t like the commotion every week so they expelled her. With no money to make, she was living in the streets where she was found by the smoothbread family who took care of her and offered a place to stay before she could stay on her feet. 

Finally, she got a building in the same street as the smoothbread bakery and opened her pharmacy there, where she kept working ever since.

Some media I got inspo from:

Uncanny Charm (manhwa) → Seleni’s backstory it has youkai, korean, legends n myths about paradise n earth n underworld

Dear Door (manhwa) → Or’ath n Fhaerta, plot about demons gods n angels + sex

Taming the Tiger (manhwa) → Or’ath n Fhaerta??? 

Fate series → The character designs, the lore, EVERYTHING. One of the original inspos. Ozymandias and Nitocris were my inspos for seleni’s design 

Baldur’s Gate 3 → ARGHHHHHH DO I GOTTA SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THIS???? After playing this game, I can confidently say that it changed my entire freaking poor life.

Cytus II → I love the lore and the world which everything happens. I used to listen to PAFF’s songs while writing about Seleni

Alchemy of Souls (Kdrama) → the lore is very interesting!!! It was about mages/sorcerers and reincarnation, soul switching stuff.

Death Parade (anime) → the Quindecim bar where they determine the dead’s fate (Abyss or Paradise)

Seduce Me (visual novel) → demons n witches?

MY VOW TO MY LIEGE → CHINESE LORE CHINESE LORE CHINESE LORE

Genshin Impact → scenery? Should I like print screen or stuff

Gallserin, an elf village hidden deep in the woods.

In the past, it used to be a village controlled by Or'ath I's cultists.

The village chief, a warlock patronized by Or'ath, ruled that place like a tyrant and would do anything for power or gold. The villagers had to pay him heavy taxes or else they wouldn't have a right to food or housing. No one would dare step in his way and those who dared would be executed publicly by the cultists.

The warlock's name: Zefhyr, Revaelor, Thalion

Thalion had a sex slave and  she would be shared with the cultists. She was Fhaerta, considered the prettiest by everyone and Thalion's favourite.

Fhaerta was sold by her parents when she was very young to loan sharks in order to pay their debts. She was taken to a research facility and organ trafficker where they conducted heart transplant experiments using alternatives and sold the hearts to traffickers. She was one of the succesful subjects in which they transplanted a machine heart.

After they had no use for her anymore, she was auctioned and bought by Thalion.

Thalion wanted to expand his territory and start a war with the neighbouring village, but he needed more power. He asked a favor from Or'ath who demanded a young woman sacrifice in exchange.

Or'ath, more than a soul devourer, he also was keen for hearts.

Thalion, chose Fhaerta as his sacrifice because there was no other young woman. But she had no heart.

Because it was urgent, he lied to Or'ath and publicly, he sacrificed Fhaerta to the devil. Claiming the gods asked for an offering to protect the village during the war. Or'ath's servant appeared that same night and took away the warlock and Fhaerta. There, the warlock was granted his wish by Or'ath and sent back. Fhaerta stayed.

Soon after that incident, Thalion was killed by Fhaerta and a new chief stepped up successfully reaching a truce. After that, the remaining cultists fled and Fhaerta was celebrated as a their saviour. Have Seleni mention Fhaerta’s aftermath somewhere, but she doesn’t say her name or whatever.

Fast forward to the future, Seleni's parents weren't able to produce offsprings and they needed an heir to become the next chief or else the father's younger brother would be chosen as the next in line. They couldn't risk that because the elders suspected him to be associated with devil cultists and Gallserin was a true hater of cultists and basically any kind of deity after the Fhaerta incident.

One night, they prayed for a child to a fertility deity.

Aadien, who received that prayer, was supposed to send it to Eden but took that opportunity for herself as it came right on time.

Aadien had a lover. A human, who had a tragic death and Aadien couldn't save them. The lover was Lilith.

Lilith's soul couldn't bear another resurrection and was to be sent to Tartarum, but Aadien couldn't let go of Lilith.

The Archdevil noticed a soul was taking longer to descend to his domain.
Aadien and the Archdevil had a secret meeting. Aadien explained to them she wanted Lilith to have one more chance at life and to meet her again. The Archdevil granted that wish in exchange for newborn souls from the deity. Aadien accepted.

Lilith's soul was successfully sent to Addamah for another reincarnation and became Seleni.

After that, Aadien was suspected of having business with the Archdevil and imprisoned until further evidence was found or proved wrong.

Before being imprisoned, she asked the Archdevil to keep expanding Seleni's life until she was released and could descend to Addamah and meet Lilith again. This time, in exchange for her god powers, which would mean she would descent to Addamah.

That's why I gave it this title. Until the Lily (Lilith) blooms (Lilith's conscience comes back)

That means Seleni's story will last until Lilith's memories are restored.

Lilith was a beautiful woman who adored lilies. She had orange hair, pale skin full of freckles and moles, garnet eyes. She was a noble and Aadien, her bodyguard (a disguise) who fell in love with her at first sight
