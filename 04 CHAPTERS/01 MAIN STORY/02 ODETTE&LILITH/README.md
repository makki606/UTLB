# ODETTE/AADIEN X LILITH

**2024.Dec.9**

[Aadien/Odette’s POV, BG Lilith’s room]

az “My liege, it’s time for your bath.”

l “Thank you, Odette.”

az “I will wait outside. Call me if you need anything.”

l “...My hands…”

l “My hands are a little sore from this morning’s sword training.”

l “Wouldn’t you help me bathe?”

az “I’m afraid this is not permitted, my liege.”

l “But you are a woman…!”

az “I gave up being a ‘woman’ the moment I decided to join the royal army. From the kingdom’s eyes, I’m a soldier, a tool for killing.”

az  “A tool could never dare touch the princess while carrying twisted intentions.”

l “Sometimes, you’re too uptight.”

l “No one will ever know! All the other servants are somewhere else.”

az “My liege… I cannot risk losing my rank and being torn apart from you. So much that I would rather not touch you for as long as I live if it means that I can remain by your side.”

l “So dramatic.”

az “It’s not that. I just desire you in a way that is too strong for my own good.”

l “Alright, Ms. Eloquence. I understand.”

l “...Will you at least help me undress?”

az “Understood.”

az “I thought you were refusing marriage requests.”

l “I am.”

az “Then why?”

l “My father forced me into this.”

l “It was the first time he ever hit me.”

l “By seducing the prince into marriage, the East King is forced to cease his threats and sign a truce with father.”

l “Now the two nations combined, we become the most powerful and consequently, other kingdoms won’t dare go against us.”

Aadien, while strolling the Earth, came across Lilith in a garden at night. It was love at first sight.

Lilith is an albino 

poor eyesight

she can’t go under the sun 

nystagmus

grey eyes (purple hue tint)

white blondish hair

Lilith, being albino, she wasnt allowed to go out in the sun unless completely covered and she had to be escorted at all times

Aadien in order to get closer to lilith, took the form of lilith’s personal bodyguard and revealed herself as a woman.

eventually they formed a romantic bond

az “(the most beautiful human i have ever seen.)”

az “(so naive and frail under the moonlight, flooded by flowers)”

*rustle*

l “!!”

l “whoever you are, reveal yourself!”

l “i’m going to scream-!”

az “...my apologies, princess. It wasn’t my intention to spy on you.”

az “I just got lost during my nightly stroll.”

l “a woman walking by herself at night. Have you never been told it’s dangerous to go out while it’s dark?”

az “I’m honoured to be the target of your concern, my princess. But worry not, I can defend myself.”

az “The moon is just too much of a beauty to be ignored under a roof.”

l “...I happen to think the same. ”

l “The moon is my best friend. My most loyal listener.”

az “If i may add, it is also the one who magnifies your beauty, princess. I couldn’t help but get lost at the sight of your figure.”

l “you flatter me too much.”

az “I don’t. It is only the truth.”


l “will we meet again?”

az “If you wish.”
