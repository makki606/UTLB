# Until the Lily Blooms

Until the Lily Blooms – rework of a novel created in 2020.

# DESCRIPTION

This story has been an idea for quite some time now (~May 2020), and it has undergone big changes in the plot and characters too.

**2022.May.4** -  Initially, the story was inspired by Greek Mythology and the Fate series, also, all the characters from the current cast except for Seleni, Margareth and Lilith didn't exist, most of them were all added after ~Sep. 2021 (Linnett, Pierce and Circe etc).

The original main cast was Emil, Noar and Seleni and they all had each their own objectives, but during the journey, they bumped into each other and got along (just like in an RPG). 

Emil and Noar are characters that belong to actual people (my friends) and we no longer talk that much anymore about the characters like we used to at the time. Because of that, I took their characters out. 

In the original story, Seleni was actually an ancient goddess of war that was reincarnated into the body of a Satyress (whose name was Lily) and her goal was to restore her ancient power and knowledge once again. Margareth was Seleni's past lover and after reincarnating, became a magical goat and Lily's familiar. She guided Lily to a cavern which had the drawings and writings made by Seleni. When she went inside the cavern, some memories were restored and now she had to find her Axe, Lilith, to restore the remaining memories and original power. In her journey, she met Emil, a Pharaoh and Noar, a Wolf prince. 

Seleni was a character created in May 2020 and has been redesigned many times, but the concept stayed the same. 


Because I decided to add a side plot love story, I created Camille with the purpose of being her love interest.

Camille is a character whose design already existed and he was an OC I named Leonidas (Nov. 2020). Leonidas was an empty character with no backstory at all. He was just a Tibetan traveller with a camel. I took Leonidas design and adjusted to fit Seleni's story. I named him Lucuma/Camille. 

Camille's design and backstory were the ones that has changed the most from the current one. But in all designs, his human form stayed practically the same, I only changed his name.

On his first redesign, I made him a Nephilim. His father was a fallen angel and his mother a human. He had the ability of shape-shifting and his humanoid form had golden wings. His skin was black and the tips of hands and feet glowed golden light and his hair was platinum peach. He was almost 2m tall, pointy feet, finger and ears and surprisingly, no horns. Also, he could create weapons with ease and portals from water puddles. 

I actually used to have something like a shapeshifter OC, a Were-crow or something and I based Camille's encounter with Seleni off of that character, Ethan n Shawn (other ocs). I think they are inside one of the sketchbooks from 2019.

His second re-redesign: I changed Camille from a Nephilim to a Cambion (a half-demon, half-human) whose father was a demon from the Chaos lineage. He grew up in a human village, raised by his mother alone since his father was something like an army general in the Underworld. 
At 8yo, he and his mother moved to the Underworld to live with his father. His mother had to pretend she was a hybrid and rarely came out of the house because the Chaos Clan wasn't welcoming of humans. Camille hated there and the dark atmosphere. Once, a rebellion striked and there was a human invasion which caused disorder in the kingdom. Demon soldiers were now breaking in every home searching for any human trace. One day they found Camille's mother and burned her alive while his father did nothing to stop. 

Camille ran away from there and looked for shelter at his former village and did everything to erase his past forming a huge grudge against his father. From then on, he pretended to be human and to have led a simple life. He named himself Lucuma after a fruit he had eaten in one of his trips, because Camille was the name his father had given him. 

The tattoo thing and Madeleine remained. 
Right now I'm still building his character and changing some of his traits, specially appearance. You can read his current backstory at one of those documents I have of him. 

Pierce and Linnett are characters I introduced later in the story. In the first drafts, Pierce was Camille's best friend, they were raised together and Linnett was introduced later to them by Seleni. I had to change cuz of life span of course.

Finally, in this month (May 2022), I started developing the characters more and trying to go on with the story. 

I gave it a title since it had none: TILL THE LILY BLOOMS 
  - **Lilies represent Seleni, besides being her favourite flower, the orange Lily represents death and the white one birth I think.**
  - In the current story, Seleni's body was chosen as Margareth's vessel so they could possess her body and reunite with Lilith. So, once in a while, Seleni has the same nightmare, because it's like Margareth manifesting their power inside Seleni, trying to take over. In the nightmare, there is a single white Lily seed that is slowly growing and it grows a little each nightmare she has. 
  - Therefore, when the Lily blooms in Seleni's nightmare, Margareth will be able to possess her body and her soul will fade away to give space to the demigod.  
This story happens in the DnD universe with Greek/Roman mythology traits and my own changes and additions to fit my liking and flow of the plot. 

**2024.Jul.11** – I was hit with a sudden burst of motivation to plan this novel better and possibly rewrite it in a near future. Give me 3 months to try and write everything I need to finally complete this story. I have had it in my mind for so long (about 4 years), I’m dying to write everything down.

**2024.Sep.29** – Here I am trying to rewrite everything from scratch.
