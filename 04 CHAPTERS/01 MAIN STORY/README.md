# MAIN STORY

**2024.nov.25**

i wanna write an ending where the true narrator is Or'ath or like Hatoful bf where the pov switches at the near end

**beginning:**

Seleni and orath work together nd are already friends

Seleni begins having nightmares n suicidal thoughts (Lilith’s not hers)

research suicidal behavior, thoughts, ptsd 


Orath has been working for Seleni in order to pay for damaging her store and medicine after causing a fire in the pharmacy. 

Orath used to be a bounty hunter n was hunting a giant wasp that flew inside Sheep’s Pharm. He failed to hit the wasp with a firebolt and caused a fire, damaging 6 months' worth of goods.


Seleni used the opportunity to get him to work in order to pay his debt. 


Story begins after about 3 months of them together.

😧 "-Seleni!!"

Camille whispers in my ear, before facing the old lady in front of us.

🤨 "is this really the time for u to be spacing out?"

😅 "Sorry, ma'am, she's had quite the long day, I hope you understand."

🤗 "It's alright, young man. I am to blame for coming after ur closed."
😟 "I panicked when Toby fainted and I had nowhere else to go but here."

O 🙂 "I can assure you did the right thing."

🙂 S "Don't worry, ma'am, I promise you Toby will be alright. Can I hold him?"

Lady 🙂 "Oh, yes, please"


I take the sleeping puppy from her arms and place my hand on its chest. Then, I pull up the puppy's eyelids to examine its eyes.

(Good. There is a pulse here. Nothing demonic either.)

(Seems like some basic healing will do.)

With a deep breath, I begin stringing together magical words that form a soothing melody. [healing word spell]

In a few seconds, the puppy opens its eyes.

😭 "Oh, Toby youre awake!!! Come here, my baby!"

😉 S "His heartbeat is weak so you should take him to a vet tomorrow for a checkup, alright? And if necessary, come back here so I can prescribe you some medicine, ma'am."

🥹 "Yes, I will! Thank you so much, Ms. Seleni!"

😁 "It's my pleasure."

😮 "Are you a cleric by chance?"

🤗 "Nothing of the sort. I'm just your local pharmacist."


The lady waves us goodbye and we head back inside the store.

😄 S "Phew! We're done! Good work today!"

🙂 O "Good work."

🙁 O "Hey, what was that before? It's not like you to space out during work."

🙂 S "Oh, I'm not sure. I heard some of voices in my head and...they were screaming for wine."

😮‍💨 O "Really? Wine?"

S 😁 "What can I do? I haven't drank a single sip of the holy blood today."

S 😃 "Oh! I just had an awesome idea! Let's eat at Gayora's!"

O 😐 "I'll have to pass. Madeleine's waiting for me at home."

S 😆 "Your familiar can wait! Let's get hammered!!!"

I grab him by the arm and drag him outside.

O 😥 "Wait, we have to lock the store-!"

scene:

End of the day, black bg

S (Ever since the beginning of spring Ive started hearing these loud voices deep inside my head alongside nightmares that give me terrible headaches and stings)

S (It's strange because they seem like they are my own, but I can't recognize shit.)

S (Most of the times I hear loud suicidal thoughts coupled with, I dunno how to describe it...)

S (Visions? Memories? Like tiny glimpses of a life that isn't mine.)

S (I tried seeing many doctors but they dont seem to know the exact cause and can only speculate.)

S (When I try to explain further, they end up suggesting therapy and even exorcisms.)

S (Of course, there are priests too, but I'm just not that religious of a person.)

S (Bah. I should sleep.)

banter scene:
context (Seleni is 500+ years old. Camille is 450 yo. A satyr's lifespan is 500y, an elf is 750y. Or'ath is disguising as Camille, he's 1000+yo)


O 🤨 "Honestly, how come we look the same in age when youre supposed to be dead? Ur way past ur time here."

S 🙂"I have no idea either, but my parents always used to tell me i was special because I was blessed by a god so that might have something to do with it...?"

S🙂 "I dunno, but I stopped worrying about that way too long ago. I guess, when i start to see wrinkles on my skin I'll be plenty enough ready to accept death without regrets."

S😉 "And Ill invite you to my funeral dont worry!"

O 😀 "I do hope to live long enough to be at ur funeral. Cuz at this rate, you might outlive me."

S 🙂"Now, don't say that. I wanna grow old and retire before you. I don't wanna win against an elf."

S 🙂 "And I hope to leave my pharmacy in your good hands."

S 😀 "Hey, I think I should start writing my will-"

O 😐 "No, I don't want ur pharmacy. I dont even have a degree in anything."

S 🙂 "Then you can sell it to someone willing to buy it."

O 😑 "That would be irresponsible and unthoughtful."

S🤨 "What. I wouldn't care. I would be dead."

O 😮‍💨 "Well, I do care about ur legacy and the hard work u put into this business. I wouldnt like for its name to be sullied by anyone."

S ☺️ "Awww, Camille. Thats so sweet."





S 😮 “Amazing. Ur almost close to quitting ur debt here. 5 months went by incredibly fast. Good job.”

O 😕 “That’s nice”

S 🤨 “That's nice? Thats all you have to say? You will be free from working here wageless in a few weeks and you think thats nice? The heck?”

O 🫤 “It might sound weird, but i grew attached to everyone here, this place, you…”

O 😕 “It’s great that i will be able to pay for the damage id done, i just don't feel excited to leave.”

S 🙂 “Who said you had go leave?”

S “You can still work here if you wish. I just assumed you'd prefer going back to your previous way of living, y'know, hunting and catching bounties.”

O “I do enjoy it. But i also realized i like working here.”

S “Next month im turning u into an official employee then Congrats!”

orath tries to conjure dispel good and evil

Yzra: "I wouldn't do that if i were you."

"You dont know whats keeping her alive"

"is it a god? Or the devil? or something else entirely?"

"think rationally. ur being hasty."

O "...ur right."

O "...Hells, i almost made a huge mistake here."

O "do you have a suggestion?"

Y "i do but ur gonna despise me for even thinking about it."

O "No."

O "I know u were thinking about the king"

Y "Well, u gotta admit ur father is exceptional-"

O "i refuse to acknowledge his existence"

Y "whoa kinda harsh"

O "im not evil. i wont let myself be associated with him or any of his kind. you can never know their true intentions, but u can be certain theyll never be good"

Y "maybe u are right. but we have priorities here. who cares about the price? Her life shouldn't be evaluated!"

O "...there must be another way."

Y "Dont waste time then."

Oi "haha...now this is something."

Oi "I cant assure you. she can die during the process and if she dies ill be severing a contract between a god and the fucking archdevil. This would impose the biggest threat ever to my position here"

Oi "ill have to part her soul in two parts and extract one half to implamt it inside a clone"

Oi "However, nothing has ever been difficult to the likes of me."

Oi "Expect this to cost a million soul coins. Be sure to think about what youre doing. Are you sure you wanna risk my throne, the balance of this plane and your life, all because of this one unlucky creature?"

O "Yes. I do think you owe me for sucking as a father the last few millenia"

O "And also... she's my Fhaerta. I would do anything for her."

Oi "You really are my son."

O "...now you realize?"
