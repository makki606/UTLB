# LUNÆTTA
The world is called LUNÆTTA (Lua + Planeta yassified) and also a reference to a story I wrote in 2018 “A visita a um outro mundo” and the world was called Lunarius (I think you can find it written somewhere I hope. Maannn that sure brings back some funny memories...)

It was inspired by DnD, Greek and Roman mythology along with basically every work of fantasy fiction I’ve ever read. I have no idea how ill even credit everything or will I?

All kinds of beings can live in this world, just like in DnD and other fantasy rpgs.  Magic is also possible. I prefer to not establish any particular rules to it though, so it doesn’t affect future stories.

There are countless languages and dialects. The main one is Common which is learnt by basically every living being who wishes or has to interact outside their species or culture.

In the future, you can use this universe to base off your writings too. 

A reminder, just in case this isn’t extremely obvious to me/us: because YOU/WE are the author and creator, obviously, you/we know everything. However, the characters and the living beings of Lunætta don’t know or understand how their world works completely, many don’t have a fucking idea. That’s how religions, theories, rumours, stories are created.
