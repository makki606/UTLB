UNTIL THE LILY BLOOMS

VN GAME PROJECT -- 2024 ver.

# DESCRIPTION: 

[]{#anchor}This story has been an idea for quite some time now (\~May 2020), and it has undergone big changes in the plot and characters too.

**2022.May.4 -  ***Initially, the story was inspired by Greek Mythology and the Fate series, also, all the characters from the current cast except for Seleni, Margareth and Lilith didn\'t exist, most of them were all added after \~Sep. 2021 (Linnett, Pierce and Circe etc).*

The original main cast was Emil, Noar and Seleni and they all had each their own objectives, but during the journey, they bumped into each other and got along (just like in an RPG). 

Emil and Noar are characters that belong to actual people (my friends) and we no longer talk that much anymore about the characters like we used to at the time. Because of that, I took their characters out. 

In the original story, Seleni was actually an ancient goddess of war that was reincarnated into the body of a Satyress (whose name was Lily) and her goal was to restore her ancient power and knowledge once again. Margareth was Seleni\'s past lover and after reincarnating, became a magical goat and Lily\'s familiar. She guided Lily to a cavern which had the drawings and writings made by Seleni. When she went inside the cavern, some memories were restored and now she had to find her Axe, Lilith, to restore the remaining memories and original power. In her journey, she met Emil, a Pharaoh and Noar, a Wolf prince. 

Seleni was a character created in May 2020 and has been redesigned many times, but the concept stayed the same.

Here are some of Seleni's artworks and designs throughout the years (+Camille):

Because I decided to add a side plot love story, I created Camille with the purpose of being her love interest.

Camille is a character whose design already existed and he was an OC I named Leonidas (Nov. 2020). Leonidas was an empty character with no backstory at all. He was just a Tibetan traveller with a camel. I took Leonidas design and adjusted to fit Seleni\'s story. I named him Lucuma/Camille. 

Camille\'s design and backstory were the ones that has changed the most from the current one. But in all designs, his human form stayed practically the same, I only changed his name.

On his first redesign, I made him a Nephilim. His father was a fallen angel and his mother a human. He had the ability of shape-shifting and his humanoid form had golden wings. His skin was black and the tips of hands and feet glowed golden light and his hair was platinum peach. He was almost 2m tall, pointy feet, finger and ears and surprisingly, no horns. Also, he could create weapons with ease and portals from water puddles. 

I actually used to have something like a shapeshifter OC, a Were-crow or something and I based Camille\'s encounter with Seleni off of that character, Ethan n Shawn (other ocs). I think they are inside one of the sketchbooks from 2019.

His second re-redesign: I changed Camille from a Nephilim to a Cambion (a half-demon, half-human) whose father was a demon from the Chaos lineage. He grew up in a human village, raised by his mother alone since his father was something like an army general in the Underworld. 

At 8yo, he and his mother moved to the Underworld to live with his father. His mother had to pretend she was a hybrid and rarely came out of the house because the Chaos Clan wasn\'t welcoming of humans. Camille hated there and the dark atmosphere. Once, a rebellion striked and there was a human invasion which caused disorder in the kingdom. Demon soldiers were now breaking in every home searching for any human trace. One day they found Camille\'s mother and burned her alive while his father did nothing to stop. 

Camille ran away from there and looked for shelter at his former village and did everything to erase his past forming a huge grudge against his father. From then on, he pretended to be human and to have led a simple life. He named himself Lucuma after a fruit he had eaten in one of his trips, because Camille was the name his father had given him. 

The tattoo thing and Madeleine remained. 

Right now I\'m still building his character and changing some of his traits, specially appearance. You can read his current backstory at one of those documents I have of him. 

Pierce and Linnett are characters I introduced later in the story. In the first drafts, Pierce was Camille\'s best friend, they were raised together and Linnett was introduced later to them by Seleni. I had to change cuz of life span of course.

Finally, in this month (May 2022), I started developing the characters more and trying to go on with the story. 

I gave it a title since it had none: TILL THE LILY BLOOMS 

  - **Lilies represent Seleni, besides being her favourite flower, the orange Lily represents death and the white one birth I think.**

  - In the current story, Seleni\'s body was chosen as Margareth\'s vessel so they could possess her body and reunite with Lilith. So, once in a while, Seleni has the same nightmare, because it\'s like Margareth manifesting their power inside Seleni, trying to take over. In the nightmare, there is a single white Lily seed that is slowly growing and it grows a little each nightmare she has. 

  - Therefore, when the Lily blooms in Seleni\'s nightmare, Margareth will be able to possess her body and her soul will fade away to give space to the demigod.  

This story happens in the DnD universe with Greek/Roman mythology traits and my own changes and additions to fit my liking and flow of the plot. 

**2024.Jul.11** -- I was hit with a sudden burst of motivation to plan this novel better and possibly rewrite it in a near future. Give me 3 months to try and write everything I need to finally complete this story. I have had it in my mind for so long (about 4 years), I'm dying to write everything down.

**2024.Sep.29** -- Here I am trying to rewrite everything from scratch.

**2024.Nov.12** -- OMGGGG I TOLD EDUARDO ABOUT THIS PROJECT AND NOW IM SO EXCITED TO KEEP GOING I wanna yap endlessly shit shit shit shit what do I do what if I lose motivation nooooooo I must wrap dis up duuuuddd

# BRAINSTORMING 

SKIP

I want to turn this story into a visual novel cuz it has been my dream to create one for ages, I guess like ever since 2017???

I think it all started after I watched Amnesia (anime) and found out it was adapted from a vn game. At that time I already wrote my own stories.

so there will be 3 endings like in Cytus II (game)

1\) bad ending, seleni dies and or'ath whatever

2\) good ending, seleni and or'ath manage to solve their problems and everyone's happy by the end.

3\) true ending, seleni and or'ath manage to solve their problems, with some realistic consequences and some downsides.

Bad ending will be kinda tragic for or'ath. He will be forced to eat her soul because she makes a deal with his father and he didn't want her soul and heart to be devoured by him, so he does it instead and creates a pretty grave for her inside the greenhouse which he takes it for him and becomes the new owner of Sheep Pharm carrying on her legacy.

Seleni and or'ath romance will be optional, depending on choices and they can happen in all endings.

I\'m still stuck on how to fit aadien and lilith's backstory in this

seleni was born in gallserin which was, about a thousand years ago, the place where fhaerta lived as the chief's personal slave. The chief was a warlock patronized by or'aath I. He was a tyrant and taxed the villagers highly, treating them poorly and doing basically whatever he wanted. He had a group of cultists who supported him there. The day after they sacrificed fhaerta to the devil was the day everything changed. One of the villagers witnessed fhaerta coming out of his house and the next day he was found dead so they all assumed she killed him and disappeared like a ghost. All the cultists fled, a new chief was chosen and fhaerta became a saviour figure and was celebrated by the village ever since

Seleni grew up hearing the story of fhaerta and admired the woman. She was the next in line chief of the village. Ever since young, she had to study hard to become a chief. She had arrow and bow practice, politics study, writing lessons, read books and practice ceremonial dances. She didn't enjoy doing all of that because there was no time to play and she had no friends either.

When she reached maturity, she became the new chief and was tattooed the chief crest on her spine.

She ruled a little, but her true dream was to live in the city. She loved hearing stories of wanderers and people who passed by. She wanted to explore the world and meet all kinds of people. That's when she decided to leave, leaving her position to Evion (Lael), her closest childhood friend

She sailed off far away.

She enrolled in a pharmacy school where she studied a lot but she sank in student debt. She used to live in a sharehouse and made a living by attending and healing sick people at the house. Her other housemates didn't like the commotion every week so they expelled her. With no money to make, she was living in the streets where she was found by the smoothbread family who took care of her and offered a place to stay before she could stay on her feet.

Finally, she got a building in the same street as the smoothbread bakery and opened her pharmacy there, where she kept working ever since.

Some media I got inspo from:

Uncanny Charm (manhwa) → Seleni's backstory it has youkai, korean, legends n myths about paradise n earth n underworld

Dear Door (manhwa) → Or'ath n Fhaerta, plot about demons gods n angels + sex

Taming the Tiger (manhwa) → Or'ath n Fhaerta???

Fate series → The character designs, the lore, EVERYTHING. One of the original inspos. Ozymandias and Nitocris were my inspos for seleni's design

Baldur's Gate 3 → ARGHHHHHH DO I GOTTA SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THIS???? After playing this game, I can confidently say that it changed my entire freaking poor life.

Cytus II → I love the lore and the world which everything happens. I used to listen to PAFF's songs while writing about Seleni

Alchemy of Souls (Kdrama) → the lore is very interesting!!! It was about mages/sorcerers and reincarnation, soul switching stuff.

Death Parade (anime) → the Quindecim bar where they determine the dead's fate (Abyss or Paradise)

Seduce Me (visual novel) → demons n witches?

MY VOW TO MY LIEGE → CHINESE LORE CHINESE LORE CHINESE LORE

Genshin Impact → scenery? Should I like print screen or stuff

**Gallserin**, an elf village hidden deep in the woods.\
In the past, it used to be a village controlled by Or\'ath I\'s cultists.\
The village chief, a warlock patronized by Or\'ath, ruled that place like a tyrant and would do anything for power or gold. The villagers had to pay him heavy taxes or else they wouldn\'t have a right to food or housing. No one would dare step in his way and those who dared would be executed publicly by the cultists.\
The warlock\'s name: Zefhyr, Revaelor, Thalion\
Thalion had a sex slave and  she would be shared with the cultists. She was Fhaerta, considered the prettiest by everyone and Thalion\'s favourite.\
Fhaerta was sold by her parents when she was very young to loan sharks in order to pay their debts. She was taken to a research facility and organ trafficker where they conducted heart transplant experiments using alternatives and sold the hearts to traffickers. She was one of the succesful subjects in which they transplanted a machine heart. After they had no use for her anymore, she was auctioned and bought by Thalion.\
Thalion wanted to expand his territory and start a war with the neighbouring village, but he needed more power. He asked a favor from Or\'ath who demanded a young woman sacrifice in exchange.\
Or\'ath, more than a soul devourer, he also was keen for hearts.\
Thalion, chose Fhaerta as his sacrifice because there was no other young woman. But she had no heart.\
Because it was urgent, he lied to Or\'ath and publicly, he sacrificed Fhaerta to the devil. Claiming the gods asked for an offering to protect the village during the war. Or\'ath\'s servant appeared that same night and took away the warlock and Fhaerta. There, the warlock was granted his wish by Or\'ath and sent back. Fhaerta stayed.\
Soon after that incident, Thalion was killed by Fhaerta and a new chief stepped up successfully reaching a truce. After that, the remaining cultists fled and Fhaerta was celebrated as a their saviour. Have Seleni mention Fhaerta's aftermath somewhere, but she doesn't say her name or whatever.\
Fast forward to the future, Seleni\'s parents weren\'t able to produce offsprings and they needed an heir to become the next chief or else the father\'s younger brother would be chosen as the next in line. They couldn\'t risk that because the elders suspected him to be associated with devil cultists and Gallserin was a true hater of cultists and basically any kind of deity after the Fhaerta incident.\
One night, they prayed for a child to a fertility deity.\
Aadien, who received that prayer, was supposed to send it to Eden but took that opportunity for herself as it came right on time.\
Aadien had a lover. A human, who had a tragic death and Aadien couldn\'t save them. The lover was Lilith.\
Lilith\'s soul couldn\'t bear another resurrection and was to be sent to Tartarum, but Aadien couldn\'t let go of Lilith.\
The Archdevil noticed a soul was taking longer to descend to his domain.\
Aadien and the Archdevil had a secret meeting. Aadien explained to them she wanted Lilith to have one more chance at life and to meet her again. The Archdevil granted that wish in exchange for newborn souls from the deity. Aadien accepted.\
Lilith\'s soul was successfully sent to Addamah for another reincarnation and became Seleni.\
After that, Aadien was suspected of having business with the Archdevil and imprisoned until further evidence was found or proved wrong.\
Before being imprisoned, she asked the Archdevil to keep expanding Seleni\'s life until she was released and could descend to Addamah and meet Lilith again. This time, in exchange for her god powers, which would mean she would descent to Addamah.\
That\'s why I gave it this title. Until the Lily (Lilith) blooms (Lilith\'s conscience comes back)\
That means Seleni\'s story will last until Lilith\'s memories are restored.\
Lilith was a beautiful woman who adored lilies. She had orange hair, pale skin full of freckles and moles, garnet eyes. She was a noble and Aadien, her bodyguard (a disguise) who fell in love with her at first sight

# WORLD BUILDING -- UNIVERSE LUNÆTTA

The world is called **LUNÆTTA** (Lua + Planeta yassified) and also a reference to a story I wrote in 2018 "A visita a um outro mundo" and the world was called Lunarius *(I think you can find it written somewhere I hope. Maannn that sure brings back some funny memories\...)*

It was inspired by DnD, Greek and Roman mythology along with basically every work of fantasy fiction I've ever read. I have no idea how ill even credit everything or will I?

All kinds of beings can live in this world, just like in DnD and other fantasy rpgs. Magic is also possible. I prefer to not establish any particular rules to it though, so it doesn't affect future stories.

There are countless languages and dialects. The main one is Common which is learnt by basically every living being who wishes or has to interact outside their species or culture.

In the future, you can use this universe to base off your writings too.

A **reminder**, just in case this isn't extremely obvious to **me/us**: because YOU/WE are the author and creator, obviously, you/we know everything. However, the characters and the living beings of Lunætta don't know or understand how their world works completely, many don't have a fucking idea. That's how religions, theories, rumours, stories are created.

## GEOGRAPHY

The world of **Lunætta** is divided in **3 main Planes of Existence**:

- ADDAMAH
- CAELUM
- TARTARUM

Other planes are: the **DREAMWORLD** and the **EDEN.**

Next is a half-assed scheme of how the world is supposed to look like and the **Soul Currents**, the trail of the souls:

![](Pictures/100000000000030000000300BBD8BDAC.jpg "image-preview"){width="6.362cm" height="6.362cm"} ![](Pictures/10000000000003000000030063C219C6.jpg "image-preview"){width="6.369cm" height="6.369cm"}

Below is the **Yggdrasil** (The Norse World Tree) which is something similar to how I imagine Lunætta to be like:

![](Pictures/100000000000025F00000352A08D2CCC.bmp){width="6.387cm" height="6.985cm"}

### ADDAMAH

Brown theme

It's the **Material Plane** and basically, the Earth or Overworld. It's the land of all mortal life and matter. I have yet to create a map to illustrate it. It stands in the centre of all Planes. **I consider it infinite and full of possibilities.**

Every living being, creature, whatever the fuck can enter in this plane if there are no circumstances unabling it to.

### CAELUM

Light blue and yellow theme

The Celestial plane, Heaven, the skies, paradise etc

Home of all deities, angels, unicorns and Celestial beings.

An unreachable place to normies.

The plane of Order, purity and justice.

This is the plane where the **souls of mortal lives** are sent to trial in order to decide their fate. After a mortal being dies in Addamah, its soul is immediately brought/sent to Caelum. There, the **Celestial Courts** will decide if the soul:

1.  gets to rest and wait for its next reincarnation;
2.  is too wicked, evil or restless for a reincarnation and sent to **Tartarum**, ****where it can end up becoming an Infernal being or devoured by them, or even a lost/stray soul (exceptionally rare)
3.  is too old to withstand a reincarnation so it just rests there till its lifespan ends so it, now a shell, can get sent to Tartarum to be absorbed by the **Archdevil** (the grave of the dead).

**Celestial Courts** are responsible for maintaining the order and justice in Caelum, and if necessary, interfere in Addamah. Their main function is to review and judge the souls that come to Caelum, and administrate the Plane of the skies. The Court is formed by authority figures such as higher deities/gods or angels, specially deities of justice.

There is also the **Celestial Supreme Court**, the highest judicial court in Caelum. They are the final arbiter of the laws of Lunætta. The Supreme Court is only summoned in extreme or important cases such as matters involving deities or angels. For example, they have the power to banish angels from Caelum, punish deities, imprison them, persecute enemies etc.

### TARTARUM

Red and black theme

The Underworld, Hell, Gehenna, the Abyss etc.

Home of demons, hell hounds, the Devil and all Infernal beings.

Another unreachable place to normies.

The plane of Chaos, evil and darkness.

**The Archdevil** is the king and ruler of Tartarum and it employs powerful **devil officers** to make ruling easier, they end up doing all the work though. His main job is to absorb shells of dead souls, hence why he's called the **Grave of the Dead**. He's the most comprehensible of all Infernal beings as long as Caelum continues to feed him souls and their shells.

Tartarum is infinite and the most developed regions are the ones that surround the "main" kingdom of the Archdevil (he is said to be everywhere all at once, omnipresent), these surrounding areas are divided into nations with each having their own ruler. Nothing much is known about the peripheries, besides them being filled with Infernal matter, demons, all kinds of fiends and disorder.

There are 13 nations that surround the centre of Tartarum, they are called the "**13 Abaddons**". Each Abaddon is ruled by a **Devil Officer**, usually addressed as "**generals of Tartarum**". They are extremely powerful and intelligent/rational devils that would only lose to the Archdevil himself in a hypothetical fight, and even if they all joined forces to oppose the Archdevil, they wouldn't be able to defeat him. The generals usually don't get along with each other but also they avoid engaging in fights and treat each other with minimum respect.

### EDEN

Aka. The Great Garden of Eden.

A smaller plane. This is the place where souls are born and cultivated. The deities of fertility are responsible for creating and taking care of newborn souls, they also employ young angels to help them.

In the **Great Garden**, the souls are like flowers. They start off as seed which will grow into flowers and when it blooms, they will be fully formed souls ready to be sent and incarnated in Addamah. The deities' main job is to ensure this process of cultivating souls is as perfect as possible and to correct any defects along the way, such as pruning, watering it etc

The deities of fertility can come in and go as they please, other Celestial beings aren't allowed to step in unless given permission by a Celestial Court. Addamah and Tartarum are prohibited from stepping in this plane, and they can't.

### DREAMWORLD

The world of dreams, only reachable through dreams ofc or Dreamers, Lucid dreamers. It doesn't exist materially in any way.

## TIMELINE

I wanted to create a universe where I wouldn't be limited because of the time setting, so I decided to make it a big mixture. There are many continents in Lunætta, each continent has its own history and are in different phases of development regarding technology.

UTLB will happen in a continent where there isn't modern technology, so no phones or Internet for example. It will be set in a time similar to the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in Europe. Cars are rare, many people use bicycles, carriages or other means of transportation. That doesn't mean they don't know modern technology, because "globalization". Other continents have and use advanced technology, so some people have and use them. For example, Seleni has freezers and a fridge.

## LANGUAGE

Almost all living beings of Addamah can speak **COMMON**, of course, there are different accents, slang and regionalismos, but it's essentially the same. They grow up speaking this language and it's also a mandatory language in schools. Unless they were raised in isolated communities, conservatory groups or something along these lines, they won't know how to speak it.

Every species has their own language and dialects.

In Tartarum, Infernal beings speak **INFERNAL**, some creatures even forgot how to speak.

In Caelum, **CELESTIAL** is spoken by Celestial beings.

## SOCIETY & RACES

Although each community has its own culture, traditions and rules, society is divided by a **Caste System**. The races and species are classified according to their lifespan, individual power and intelligence.

Below is the ranking of some races not in order (may change in the future):

While the higher ranks are admired or feared, the lower ones tend to be looked down upon or pitied. The Undead usually live as outcasts or isolated in suburbs or slums.

Currently, the caste system doesn't hold that much importance to the majority of folk, who prefer to live in harmony without being prejudiced, however, the conservative or the wealthy still care for and try to reinforce the ranking system.

Next is some info of some races + my headcanons:

### DEITY/GOD

Extremely powerful magical beings, capable of pretty much everything as long as they specialize in it. Sempiternal, immortal beings. The only way to kill a deity is if all their worshippers cease to exist. Most of Addamah believes in the existence of deities with each community having a specific deity (or more) to serve, follow or celebrate. So, as long as religious people continue to exist, deities will too.

**Gods have 3 eyes or more and they can appear anywhere on their body**. The amount of eyes is proportional to their power, though, that's not always true. They can assume whichever from/shape they wish. Their true form is actually inexistent since their life depends on the belief/faith of beings in Addamah.

Deities can possess whichever thing or living being they wish and not disturb the soul inside the body about to be possessed for a while (unlike demons who rob the soul or devour it). If they wish to take full possession of a certain body, they don't need to seal any contract and can just absorb the soul. However, that's a forbidden act by the Supreme Celestial Court and the deity will be severely punished. A soul possession is a very heavy toll on an Addamah living being's body, so very few survive if not aided.

### DEVILS / DEMONS

Chaotic, evil, carefree, narcissistic, possessive, greedy and manipulators. Very few are good-aligned or carry positive traits. Like angels and deities, they can also assume whichever shapes they want. Their true form can only be seen by Celestial or Infernal beings, although, they can be felt if they touch an Addamah living being. They are described as a freezing or scalding hot fog. Also, basically immortal, unless if eaten by a more powerful Infernal being or annihilated by a deity/angel.

Demons/Devils can enter in Addamah, however, they can't touch or feel anything in their true form, **except for the Archdevil and some of the Devil generals**. In order to step in Addamah materially, they need to be summoned or to seal a soul contract with something/someone that lives there and possess their body. In a soul contract, the contractant will become the demon/devil's gate from Tartarum to Addamah. It's usually a one time thing: if the demon/devil returns to Tartarum after they've possessed a body (the contractant dies after), they will need to seal another contract next time they wish to go to Addamah. That's because they take the soul for themselves and absorb/devour it. But for **devils**, one way to solve this is to seal a heavier contract which is to make an Addamah being their permanent gate by taking full possession of the contractant's soul instead of absorbing/devouring it. With this, they can come and go whenever they like. This contract is called **SOUL BINDING**, also referred to as "marriage" by devils. However, they can only accomplish this contract if they have full consent of the contractant and they can't be tricked into a Soul Bind unlike the many other soul contracts. The Archdevil and some of the devil officers don't need to do that.

**Difference between demons and devils:**

Demons can't be reasoned with. They are beasts made of pure hatred and destruction, and many are used by devils as soldiers and slaves. They have no rules and are usually summoned for battles.

Devils are intelligent, rational beings. They have laws, rules, values and a society/hierarchy. They like to exploit, manipulate and do things for their own benefit. They are still evil, but can be pragmatic and even do good deeds as long as they get something in return.

### ANGEL

Creatures of Caelum. They are born in the skies and will die, if they do, in the skies. They are considered immortal beings. Magical, very powerful and gleam in light. They are warriors and assist/serve deities in their many duties such as protecting Caelum from possible invaders.

All angels are born blind. Appearance wise, they will usually have something covering their eyes or restraining their sight. It can be a piece of cloth, feathers, horns, sewn eyes anything. This is a trait that represents justice and lack of prejudice.

### SATYR

Horny alcoholics 24/7. They need alcohol (usually wine) to survive, like water to most creatures.

They usually live in the woods, alone or in groups of 2-3 among other creatures' communities. They have the ability to speak to animals.

## MAGIC SYSTEM

Magic isn't accessible to everyone.

Species born without magic have to learn it by spell casting and this is usually reserved for the wealthy or powerful. An alternative way would be to seal a contract with a devil and be sustained by them, but it's not the most advisable decision.

Species who are born magical have to learn it since early unless their community forbiddens it for a specific reason.

There are also individuals who are born in mage lineages (mage blood), who can cast and manipulate magic, even if their species aren't able to use it or see it.

The ones that use magic, specially when living in a continent/community with magicless species, they are obliged to carry documents (issued by the local government) approving of their use of magic and have consequences if used it in any evil ways.

### **FORBIDDEN SPELLS** by the **Supreme Court** (from most to least dangerous/costly):

- Resurrection;
- Soul Replication;
- Immortality;
- Soul Theft;
- Soul Link;
- Soul Possession by a Deity (not exactly a spell, but extremely advised against).
- Memory Modification/Erasure of masses;

Besides from requiring immense amounts of mana to cast, these are spells that break or disturb the balance of life in Lunætta and therefore, using them are extremely forbidden and come with dangerous consequences.

Few Celestial beings (angels and deities, for example) have the power of casting these spells, but would be heavily punished for doing so, it would mean corruption of the self. No deity/angel in their sane state of mind would dare or dream to use them.

Devils are free to cast these spells with little to no consequences, but, as known, they need to seal soul contracts to use them or immense amounts of mana/power, which many don't have. The Archdevil and the 13 Generals use these spells on a frequent basis, but because they are aware of the balance of life, they charge expensively from their contractants.

### LIST OF SPELLS MENTIONED/DESCRIBED THROUGHOUT THE STORY

They're basically all taken from the 5e player handbook.

Seleni was born in Gallserin, daughter of the village chief and the next in line.

Gallserin is an atheist village. They choose to not follow/celebrate any deity at all since the Fhaerta incident. Fhaerta is seen as a saviour and sent to their villages to kill the evil which was Thalion. Thalion called himself "sent by the gods" a profet. And the villagers stopped believing after Fhaerta killed him. the village started to rebuild itself after that.

Seleni's parents couldn't conceive a child and made an offering to a fertility deity wishing for a child. Aadien received the prayer and sent Lilith.

Ever since Seleni was a kid, she was taught and had to study many subjects in order to become the next chief. She had many duties to keep unlike the other kids. Because of that, she didn't have many friends. She also had a private mentor so she didn't go to classes like the others. Evion was her closest friend, he would sneak inside her tent and take her out to play in the woods with him. They would go hunting, fishing etc.

On the day she became chief, she was tattooed with the village crest and there was a big ass celebration in the village and she did the ceremonial dance every chief has to learn.

\[seleni was born in gallserin which was, about a thousand years ago, the place where fhaerta lived as the chief's personal slave. The chief was a warlock patronized by or'aath I. He was a tyrant and taxed the villagers highly, treating them poorly and doing basically whatever he wanted. He had a group of cultists who supported him there. The day after they sacrificed fhaerta to the devil was the day everything changed. One of the villagers witnessed fhaerta coming out of his house and the next day he was found dead so they all assumed she killed him and disappeared like a ghost. All the cultists fled, a new chief was chosen and fhaerta became a saviour figure and was celebrated by the village ever since

Seleni grew up hearing the story of fhaerta and admired the woman. She was the next in line chief of the village. Ever since young, she had to study hard to become a chief. She had arrow and bow practice, politics study, writing lessons, read books and practice ceremonial dances. She didn't enjoy doing all of that because there was no time to play and she had no friends either.

When she reached maturity, she became the new chief and was tattooed the chief crest on her spine.

She ruled a little, but her true dream was to live in the city. She loved hearing stories of wanderers and people who passed by. She wanted to explore the world and meet all kinds of people. That's when she decided to leave, leaving her position to Evion (Lael), her closest childhood friend and her cousin.\]

Seleni travelled a lot before settling in \[coastal city name, Waterhook Harbor\]

She started out as a healer/herbalist freelancer gipsy

then she found a share house, but was expelled after too many people started to gather around looking for healing.

He was born neutral and unable to be evil just because which led him to become a loner and begin to hole himself inside the royal library. He eventually learned he was Or'ath I's son. No demon devil would dare touch or mess with him. He learned about his mother Fhaerta after he sneaked inside his father bedroom and found Fhaerta's diary and painted portrait.

### EARLY LIFE:

Elaith: \"\...I was born an Elf of black eyes and useless legs. It was a huge shock to our aristocrat parents who live to preach about our \'almighty\' race. For them, I was an insult, a disgrace to our bloodline. After all, **Elves with black eyes** are believed to bring misfortune and, consequently, excluded from their community.\"

Seleni: I\'ve heard that before when I was young. The elders used to tell us that black eyes meant that the Elf\'s soul was touched by the Corrupted before coming to Addamah (Earth).

E: \"Desperate to deny my existence, our parents didn\'t allow me to go outside our household nor see anyone at all. But rumours started to grow and my parents just couldn\'t hide me forever. Then that night came.... I woke up and **my eyes were burning, it hurt so much and I struggled and screamed but father wouldn\'t release my hands while mother cried on top of me, with the lighter in her hands**. Fortunately, Deldrach barged in and stopped them from going any further.\"

### FACTS/TRIVIA:

Wheelchair user

he admires Seleni

\"It might sound silly now, but growing up, you were kinda like a fairy tale to me. I liked to hear the maids talking about how this wonderful Satyress healed their children miraculously and inside me started to grow a spark of hope. What if she could heal me? Y\'know, I was just a kid and... I wanted my vision back,\" his eyes started to tear up, \"\...I loved my black eyes...! How was I supposed to understand why my parents hated me?! I was just a kid!\"

Eliath bursted into tears and I hugged him, also teary-eyed. Deldrach stood by our side, quiet, with a pained look on his face.

With hiccups, he calmed himself down and his tone did too.

\"As crazy as it sounds, I don\'t blame my parents for what happened to me. I felt the sadness in my parents\' hands when they held me that night... What I truly hate is this society that drove them to act this way. I hate the ranks. I hate the people that decided that it was ok to divide living beings on who could step on who and who they had to bow down to.\"

# STORY MAP AND OUTLINE

## GENERAL DESCRIPTION

### WHAT IS IT ABOUT? 

The story starts describing the daily life of a centuries old satyress who owns a pharmacy in a busy city. That is, until some secrets start unveiling themselves. She discovers she is involved in some god/devil deal and that soon her consciousness will disappear and give place to the past bearer of that soul who is hibernating deep inside Seleni's consciousness. Seleni slowly begins to understand the shit she's in and now has a decision to make, or accept the lack of one.

### WHAT ARE THE STAKES AND CONFLICTS? 

Or'ath, Seleni's friend/lover doesn't want Seleni to give up her life because a god and a devil planned a scheme together. He sees himself on her, and wishes for her to go against her fate, just like he did. Seleni is divided. Although she doesn't want to give up her life, she also thinks she has lived enough and is afraid to go against the divine/infernal. That will be for the player to decide: if seleni gives up her body to the deity or if she tries to find a solution.

### WHAT IS THE RESOLUTION? 

For the good ending, Seleni makes a deal with Or'ath I and asks him to create a replica of her soul and later for Or'ath to build a homunculus and implant her soul in it, so she can spend the rest of her life with him. The original soul would be given to Aadien so she could reunite with Lilith.

For the normal/true ending, Seleni gives away her soul to Aadien and never meets Or'ath I in this route. Or'ath visits Gallserin to mourn Seleni and discovers a little more about his mother's past.

For the bad ending, Or'ath doesn't stay by and Seleni kills herself only to be resurrected by Circe, she awakes as Lilith and eventually taken by Aadien.

Or'ath I x Fhaerta

OCT 2024

## DESCRIPTION + AFTERTHOUGHTS: 

This is the story of how Fhaerta and Or'ath met and fell for each other, eventually leading to the birth of Or'ath II. I wrote this short story to show the reason why Or'ath I neglected his own son. I tried writing it in a visual novel format.

I'm very proud of this short story even though it started solely as a brainstorming of ideas for this couple. I ended up polishing it enough to be called a story.

My idea for these two is to convey how their love is toxic, but in a way, "healthy" enough for Fhaerta, who led a very messed up life till the end. Or'ath I is a red flag and his definition of love is very toxic, possessive. He sees Fhaerta as his precious pet.

This story is supposed to be a tragic dark romance.

Fhaerta is not used to speak her mind, very passive and obedient, won't question orders. She was raised to be a servant, slave and doll. That's why throughout the story she doesn't speak much, has low self-esteem, suicidal, and passive in general. **I hope to twitch the story later to convey this better**. I need to research better regarding this type of behaviour and trauma.

Or'ath I is a devil. I tried to convey his evil side, but I'm not sure I succeeded because I still wanted him to have a soft spot for Fhaerta.

And I suck at writing sex scenes.

That's it, hope it will remain a good read in the future and not too embarrassing.

## CHAPTER 1

\[Fhaerta's POV, insert Fhaerta pic\]

\[BG Fhaerta's bedroom -- morning\]

I open my drawer and take an ointment jar.

FHAERTA:

F "I'm running out of it...I should ask the healer for more later."

I wipe the jar clean with my fingers and apply it on my bruises.

F "Ouch. It kinda stings."

F (These are taking too long to heal...)

After the ointment, I change the bandages on my legs and wrists.

F "\*Sigh\* I'm sore all over my body..."

F (It's scary to even try to remember last night. He came to my room drunk and dragged me out...)

My legs begin to shake.

F (Ugh. I need to focus on something else.)

I hear footsteps and some chatter in the corridor.

F (It's the devil cultists. Are they going to his room?)

I approach the door and try to listen to what was being talked about.

CULTIST A:

"Lord Thalion is losing this war. I wonder what his next step will be."

CULTIST B:

"Surely, it won't be a cautious one after we give him this morning's report."

F (It's horrible to think this, but I wish this war could last forever.)

F (Ever since Thalion declared war against the neighbouring tribe, he has been out in the battlefield the whole day and comes back too tired to seek me.)

F (I've been using this time to sneak out and help around our tribe and talk more to the other women. I've been trying my best not to get caught by the cultists.)

F (Last time, I got an awful...beating.)

F (I wish Thalion and all his followers would just be killed in this war...)

F (But I know it's useless to wish that because of the devil that patronises him.)

F (As long as he continues to work with the devil, he can die and be revived countless times.)

CULTIST A:

"I knock and you do the talking."

CULTIST B:

"No, you."

THALION:

T "I can hear you fools by the door. Come in."

They knock and step inside Thalion\'s room which is next to mine. Again, I stick my ear close to the wall to eavesdrop their conversation.

THALION:

T "Spit it out."

CULTIST A:

"Erm..."

CULTIST B:

"We were ambushed at the bridge to the East. They had set a trap for us by the river and managed to lure the first group in. For now, we've retreated to the camp to treat the wounded."

THALION:

T "DAMNIT!"

\*bang sound and glass shatter\*

THALION:

T "WHY ARE YOU ALL USELESS PIECES OF SHIT?!"

　

THALION:

T "\...How many can still fight?!"

CULTIST A:

"\...Less than 20, my lord."

THALION:

T "For fuck's sake! We can\'t afford to lose any more battles\..."

THALION:

T "They must already know we're after the artefact inside the waterfall. This is why they've reinforced their defence around the river."

THALION:

T "Also, something is going on. Their soldiers shouldn\'t be this strong or even know we wanted the artefact. I made sure to make them believe I wanted the chief's daughter and their territory by the beach."

CULTIST A:

"You mean to say that they have something...divine on their side?"

THALION:

T "I'm afraid so."

THALION:

T "\...ARGH!"

\*bang sound\*

THALION:

T "I need more power...!"

CULTIST B:

"\...Will you visit our saviour and king Or'ath!?"

THALION:

T "Seems like I have to."

THALION:

T "\...I need that sacred artefact. It will grant me immortality and endless mana."

THALION:

T "I can even become a god!!!"

THALION:

T "Ever since I read about it in one ancient book, I've been searching all around Addamah and now, I'm this close to getting my hands on it!!!"

THALION:

T "But those old monkeys insist on defending it. They must have no idea what it even is!!! It's wasted potential on their hands."

THALION:

T "That's why I'll do anything to take it. And that means resorting to our king Or'ath to beg him for a fragment of his power."

CULTIST B:

"B-but, who knows what our king will ask in exchange?!"

THALION:

T "Considering what I'm about to ask this time, there's no doubt it will be pricey."

THALION:

T "However, there's nothing I'm afraid to lose. I've devoted my entire life to serving king Or'ath."

THALION:

T "I am his most loyal and obedient servant. If anything, he's the one owing me a few favours."

CULTIST A:

"You're... You're amazing, lord Thalion!"

The conversation ended and the men left the room.

F (I didn't really understand what their conversation was about, but I have such a bad feeling about it.)

F (He can become a god...? That would be the worst thing to ever happen to this world.)

F (Sigh.)

F (No use thinking about this. I hope to be dead by then. Considering the man he is, he would destroy everything in his sight to test his new powers.)

I snuck out the house to help around the tribe. I played with the children and braided their hair.

\[fade to black\]

...

\[BG: Fhaerta's room\]

When the sky began turning dark, I rushed back inside to my room.

F (It's a good thing there were no cultists around today.)

Soon, I heard commotion outside and I went to look at the window.

The cultists and Thalion arrived, chasing everyone away. The adults quickly caught their kids and held them in their arms.

F (Everyone is so scared...)

F (They control our food and our housing. If we don't do as they say, we are punished or killed.)

F (I hate that we can't do anything. I'm not even from here, but... I hate the me who can't even stand up for myself, much less for others.)

Footsteps began coming closer.

\*sound of footsteps approaching\*

F (I know this sound all too well. Irregular stepping, staggering...He's drunk.)

The door swings open.

THALION:

T "Come."

F "Yes, master Thalion."

I lowered my head down and quietly followed him to his room.

\[BG Thalion's room - evening\]

He took his coat and boots off, grabbed me by the head and shoved me on his bed.

THALION:

T "You're smelling awfully strange today..."

He draws his face close to my ear.

THALION:

T "And I know where this scent is from."

Then, he yanks something from my hair, pulling a few strands out.

THALION:

T "THAT'S A FUCKING LEAF, ISN'T IT?!! YOU SNUCK OUT AGAIN, HUH?! STUPID BITCH!!!"

He slaps my face.

THALION:

T "I give you food, a roof, clothing and that's how you pay me back!? *Don't you have no heart?!*"

THALION:

T "That's right! You don't have one! You're just a doll after all! A useless lab experiment! You should be glad I bought you or else they would have thrown you in the slums!!!"

THALION:

T "One thing is good about you though: your body loves to be punished. Every. Single. Time. You dirty slut."

He rips my clothes open and unbuckles his pants.

THALION:

T "Isn't it time you've learnt already?"

He turned me around, pulling my waist up.

THALION:

T "Your skin... It has always been so pale. It's beautiful... Even more with all these bruises which I've made. From white, it becomes pink and red... My favourite colours."

His hands rub my hips, butt, thighs...

He spreads my legs abruptly and begins rubbing it on me.

THALION:

T "But this place is my favourite of them all. It yearns for me."

F "S-stop!!"

THALION:

T "Why? Look, it's becoming wet already. I bet your insides even have my shape by now."

He shoves it inside me.

F "Aah!!! Ngh-N-no!!!"

I try to escape but his grip on my hips is too strong.

THALION:

T "Why do you still resist? It's useless. Just be the obedient doll you are and stay still."

\*door creaking sound\*

The door swings open.

CULTIST A:

"My lord! Our-!!"

THALION:

T "WHAT?! I'M BUSY, GET OUT."

CULTIST A:

"It's-It's urgent, my lord..."

THALION:

T "THEN SPILL IT."

CULTIST A:

"Our camp by the river... It's been attacked."

THALION:

T "WHAT?! GODDAMNIT!!!"

He yanks it out of me.

THALION:

T "You. Go back to your room. We'll finish this later."

THALION:

T "Fuck! I was only planning to summon him tomorrow!"

I rush out and shut my bedroom\'s door.

\[BG Fhaerta's bedroom - evening\]

\*door shut sound\*

F (It's over!!!)

I exhale in relief, searching for clothes to cover my body.

F (These will do.)

I ended up overhearing their loud voices when I approached the wardrobe on the wall.

THALION:

T "Hurry, cut yourself."

CULTIST A: ""M-My lord, you mean to use my blood for the summoning circle...?"

THALION:

T "What else for? Hurry up."

CULTIST A:

"Yes, my lord."

The cultist groans in pain for a few moments and shortly after, I hear a thud and the sounds stop for a while.

Then, Thalion begins mumbling words like a chant or spell.

F (I've never heard him doing the summoning ritual before...)

F (I can't understand a thing he's saying.)

F (I guess it's Infernal?)

An unknown, raspy and deep voice speaks.

???:

"What is your business with king Or'ath?"

F (Huh? Is it the devil? No...something else? It's speaking Common.)

THALION:

T "I need a favour. I need help destroying the neighbouring tribe. Something to wreak havoc, annihilate them all."

???:

"Noted. I shall return shortly."

More silence.

???:

"Half-elf. The king says he will employ one of his servants to get the work done for you."

THALION:

T "Really? That's good to hear."

???:

"However. He wants what's hidden inside the waterfalls in exchange."

THALION:

T "What!?"

???:

"You have been serving our king very well. He is proud to have such a powerful and faithful devotee. I'm sure you will not betray his expectations."

THALION:

T "N-no, this is... I told him I was after that artefact from the start and he said he would assist me with it!"

???:

"Hmm... That's unfortunate, but I'm afraid this isn't specified in your contract, half-elf."

THALION:

T "Impossible! There must be something wrong!"

???:

"Are you implying that our king Or'ath has committed a mistake?"

THALION:

T "N-never!"

THALION:

T "I haven't asked a favour bug enough for him to ask for the artefact in exchange! What...What about a heart?! I can offer a heart to him!!! He would like that, right?! Please, ask him to consider!"

THALION:

T "I swear to give him the artefact after this war!!!"

???:

"\...Very well. I will take your proposal to him."

THALION:

T "Thank you! Thank you!"

The mysterious voice disappeared.

F (What the hell is going on...)

F (The devil likes hearts...? Is that the reason we would have public executions by the cultists in our tribe every once in a while? All those ceremonies and rituals they would partake in before killing-)

THALION:

T "ARGH!"

\*loud bang sound\*

THALION:

T "I can't believe he would try to come out on top of me after all I've done!?!?"

THALION:

T "He will pay for this... I'm no mere warlock... I'M A SOON TO BE GOD!!!"

THALION:

T "A *heart* is all I need..."

He starts cackling at himself, almost evilly.

\[fade to black, time skip\]

...

\[BG Fhaerta's room\]

The next day came by and I decided to stay shut inside my room all day only heading out for basic needs.

I entertained myself by weaving some straw, a skill I learned from the people here.

F (If only I could read...)

Just when the sun had set, some cultists barged inside.

\*door abrupt opening sound\*

CULTIST A:

"You, doll. Strip down your clothes."

F "What?"

CULTIST B:

"Shut up! You're not allowed to speak!"

They came in my direction and started to pull my clothes off.

F "S-stop-!"

CULTIST B:

"Didn't I tell you to shut your mouth?!"

One of them held my arms above my head while the other tried to fit me inside a white piece of clothing he was holding under his arms.

CULTIST B:

"Fuck! How the hell am I supposed to put on this shit?!"

CULTIST A:

"Don't ask me! Figure it out yourself!"

CULTIST B:

"\...This looks good enough. Where's the red paint? Hey, put on the jewellery."

CULTIST A:

"Yeah, yeah."

F (This is the sacrificial clothing...)

F (They wear the chosen in a white gown, red makeup and gold jewellery. I've witnessed the public executions they call "sacrificial offerings" three times ever since I was brought here.)

F (So this time Thalion chose me.)

F (But he promised the devil a heart? I have none... What is he thinking about? Is this what he had in mind after being lied to by the devil?)

F (Well, this means I will finally die I assume.)

...

\[BG Gallserin tribe -- evening\]

I'm dragged outside where all the cultists and villagers are gathered around a large summoning circle with Thalion standing in the centre, holding a big torch.

THALION:

T "Hear ye, my followers! I, Thalion, the prophet of the New World and saviour have received a request during my slumber!"

THALION:

T "A mystical entity, not Celestial nor Infernal, has asked yet again for an offering in order to keep blessing our land with prosperity and fortune!!!"

THALION:

T "Tonight, we will offer them a beautiful female! It shall be content to receive such a gift and, surely, our sacrifice shall be well received by *It*!"

The villagers all glanced at me with eyes of pity and sadness, especially the children whom I used to play with. Some of the women looked about to burst in anger, glaring at Thalion.

But it didn't matter how any of us felt. We had no chance against the warlock and his followers and even if we had, the consequences wouldn't be worth it.

THALION:

T "Let us commence!!!"

They brought me to the middle of the circle then, aligned themselves around me and started to chant a long spell. Thalion, who had been grinning the entire time, also chanted along.

They finished the ritual by giving me a blood filled golden goblet for me to drink.

Then, seconds later, blinded by a steaming fog, I heard a voice say-

DEMON SECRETARY ('???'):

"Expect your recompensation in two days, half-elf."

-and whoosh, I disappeared in the blink of an eye.

## CHAPTER 2

\[BG: The Crimson Room\]

Two demons in armour grabbed me by the arms and brought me to a pompous bedroom.

(A circular room with no windows and a single king-size bed in the centre. The entire place is velvet red and adorned with gold and precious stones.)

F (This room smells strangely good\... like flowers?)

They toss me on the bed and lock me in chains.

F (Ouch. These shackles have a magical aura to them\... I guess they are built to inhibit magic.)

The two demons murmur something I don\'t understand and exit the bedroom.

\*door shutting sound\*

F (I guess this is the end.)

F (Who would have thought that after wishing for death countless times, this would be how my wish would be granted? Killed by the hands of a devil.)

F (\...do gods even exist\...?)

F (Have I sinned against the gods and this is my punishment\...?)

F (All my life I\'ve only known pain, how can I believe any god exists when all my prayers have been all for nothing?)

\*door sound followed by a shut\*

The door opens itself.

I look up and the moment my eyes lock with the abnormous figure in front of me, my whole body shivers in fear.

Even with the veil covering my face, his emerald gaze could pierce right through it and I felt like a helpless prey.

\[insert cg of orath I\]

F (So this is the devil...)

F (2 metres tall, horns, fangs, claws, wings and a tail. Just his presence alone makes me feel like I\'m close to death.)

He approaches the bed and uncovers my face, bringing his fingers to my cheeks, caressing it.

F (Gulp.)

OR\'ATH:

\"An albino half-elf... What a heavenly sight.\"

He lifted my chin up and a grin formed on his face.

OR\'ATH:

"Do you know who I am?"

F (I know it. I've heard it numerous times.)

F "\...Or'ath."

OR\'ATH:

"Correct."

OR\'ATH:

\"That human sure chose a one of a kind for his offering. You have eyes like jewellery, pale skin, silk hair\... Truly, a treat to the eyes. Although, it seems he wasn't treasuring you good enough from all these bruises on your flesh\...\"

OR\'ATH:

\"It\'s a shame that beauty is meaningless to me. I\'m much more interested in what you have here inside.\"

He released my chin and slid his finger to my chest, poking the middle with his claws.

I swallowed dry.

In an instant, he pierced my chest with his claw.

\*sound of blood spurt\*

F \"AAAGH!!!\"

I gasp in pain.

His eyes open wide and he pulls his finger out, spilling blood on my clothes.

\[blur background\]

OR\'ATH:

\"What\...?\"

OR\'ATH:

\"What is this machinery in your heart\'s place? How come you\'re alive?\"

He stares at me waiting for an answer but the pain in my chest is blurring my thoughts and I\'m unable to form words.

F \"I-\...\*huff\*\...I\'m-\"

Noticing my difficulty, he conjures a spell and touches my wound, healing it.

In a few seconds, the pain I was feeling disappears.

\[stop blur\]

OR\'ATH:

\"Now, answer my question.\"

He looks down on me, still waiting for a response.

Slowly, some words manage to come out of my mouth.

F \"\...I\'m an experiment\...My parents were deep in debt... So they sold me to scientists who implanted a machine heart inside me.\"

OR\'ATH:

\"I see. Did that half-elf know about this?\"

I nodded.

F \"He bought me at the scientists auction.\"

OR\'ATH:

\"Huh. So it seems that fool was courageous enough to deceive me.\"

He begins laughing at himself.

OR\'ATH:

\"He dared to deceive me! I wonder which would be the best punishment for him\...?\"

As if reminded that I was still here, he stopped smiling and shifted his attention to me.

OR\'ATH:

\"\...I guess I have no use for you. With a fake heart like yours, it's unlikely you will live for long. I\'ll have my slaves accompany you back-\"

F \"NO!!! I can\'t go back! I want to die, you have to kill me!!!\"

These words spilled out of my mouth in desperation.

F (Just thinking that I would return to that cycle of abuse and hurt makes my whole body weak and crack.)

F (I can\'t go back to that place! I\'d rather die by the flames of this hell!)

F (I don\'t want to have that man or any of those cultists put their hands on me ever again!!!)

F (All the nights he wouldn\'t let me rest or sleep, if I die I will be able to finally have peace...)

Tears start forming in my eyes.

F \"You have to kill me!!!\"

I break down in tears, begging him to end my life.

The devil lets out a deep sigh and mutters a spell, making the shackles come undone.

OR\'ATH:

\"Sleep. I\'ll decide what to do with you later. Also you refer to me as 'Your Majesty'. Learn some manners."

He then leaves the room.

F "\..."

F \"What\...? Did he just tell me to sleep?\"

After that, no one came inside the room anymore.

A little wobbly, I stood up and searched the room.

There were a few scented candles, ropes and chains inside the drawers, alcohol and empty glasses. At the back there was a sunken bathtub made of marble.

F (It seems this is the room where he pleasures himself with the sacrifices, before, I guess, devouring their hearts.)

F (\...I assume he will try to use me before killing me.)

F (Sigh.)

Eventually, tiredness won over me and I gave myself up to sleep.

\[fade to black\]

\...

I wake up, feeling my throat dry.

F (How much time has passed...?)

F (When was the last time I slept for this long, to the point of losing track of time and day?)

I turn my head around and find the devil standing beside the bed, looking straight at me.

OR\'ATH:

"You've woken up."

I jump in place and quickly sit myself up with my knees bent.

OR\'ATH:

"Strip yourself, woman."

F (Oh... Seems I was right after all.)

F (I have no will left to even hesitate.)

I start pulling down the sleeves of the white dress stained with my blood, avoiding his gaze so I wouldn't tremble in fear.

OR\'ATH:

"You're surprisingly obedient. That will make things easier."

OR\'ATH:

"Take the jewellery off too."

I finished pulling off the dress and reached for the gold earrings the cultists made me wear.

The devil kept staring at me the entire time, focused.

F (I can't read what he's thinking at all.)

I put the clothes and jewellery aside and sit on my knees, facing him.

OR\'ATH:

"Open your mouth."

He pulls my chin down with his thumb and index.

OR\'ATH:

"Now, drink."

He proceeds to pour water inside my mouth from a glass.

F (Since when did he have a glass of water in his hand?)

I gulp down the water causing me instant relief.

OR\'ATH:

"Normally, I would have been more than happy to grant your wish to be killed. However, I don't enjoy receiving orders and wishes come with a price."

OR\'ATH:

"Since you're so eager to have me end your miserable life, surely, you wouldn't mind satisfying me with your flesh first."

He pushes two of his pointy fingers inside my mouth, spreading it open.

OR\'ATH:

"Suck."

I lick his fingers, twirling my tongue around them, letting my saliva drip out of my mouth, sometimes brushing my teeth against them.

OR\'ATH:

"\...You really were his slut, huh."

He takes his fingers out and pushes me down on the bed, pinning my hands.

\*sound of fabric rustling and a thud\*

Like a predator who's tasting his prey, he starts to lick and nibble on every part of my body.

My hands are released and his head moves down. He spreads my legs open and caresses my thighs before burying his mouth in me.

F (It's no surprise that he would be really skilled in doing this.)

F (But my body has long become numb to pleasure.)

F (I want this to be over fast... I just need to hang on a little more...)

Without realising, tears start streaming down my face.

F (Why do I still cry at times like this? I still feel hurt and so\...disgusting.)

The devil stopped upon noticing my sniffing. He stood up and let out a sigh.

He murmurs something in his language, kind of grumpily, and walks to the door.

Just before leaving, he turns around to face me and says:

OR\'ATH:

"I remembered I have matters of urgency to attend to. I shall postpone your death for another hour. As for the time being, suit yourself. Have a bath or read some of the books scattered around, if you're knowledgeable in Infernal."

\*sound of door shut\*

And he left.

F \"\...\"

F (What just happened\...?)

F (Why did he suddenly stop? Was it because of my crying? )

F (\...I guess it\'s no use thinking about anything.)

I walk to the bathtub which is filled with warm water and step inside.

\[pic of bathtub filled with water\]

F \"It was empty before. Does it fill itself? Or did he do it?\"

F (I dare to say this place has been feeling much more comfortable and peaceful then the Overworld. Obviously, I\'m mistaken, but it\'s been so long since I was able to have a warm bath and good sleep\... There are even clean clothes inside the closet\...)

I wash myself with soap and let my mind relax.

It didn\'t take long for the hot steam to get to my head and I ended up dozing off inside the water.

\[fade to black\]

\...

F (I slept again\...)

F (I was really tired.)

F (Huh? I\'m on the bed and have a robe on\...)

OR\'ATH:

\"Is sleeping the only thing you do?\"

F "?!"

F (He startled me!)

F \"\...Sorry. I think I was tired.\"

OR\'ATH:

\"You were tired?\"

F "I haven't slept in a while."

He puts his hand on my head and closes his eyes.

Like a bunch of cards, I feel my memories being shuffled around and looked through.

\[blur background\]

F (Scenes of my life were flashing inside my head: things I didn't know I forgot, things I swore to forget, things I wish I could forget about.)

F (The happy memories... are so little.)

F (This is making me feel dizzy...)

OR\'ATH:

\"\...I see how it is.\"

He starts laughing.

OR\'ATH:

\"I already know what will be the perfect punishment.\"

He glares at me with a vicious grin plastered on his face.

OR\'ATH:

\"\...And you will be my special guest.\"

\[BG: Gallserin tribe -- night\]

The devil dressed me in a black cloak and teleported us to the above.

My body froze itself the moment I realised where we were and my breath got stuck in my throat.

F (His house...)

OR\'ATH:

"He must be sleeping. Let us sneak inside."

He gently took my hand and carried us through the door to the warlock's bedroom.

\[BG Thalion's room -- night\]

F (I hate being familiar with this room.)

F (I know where he keeps each book and how he prefers them to be organised, I know each piece of clothing he owns, I know where he keeps his gold, and also, his toys...)

Without noticing, my hands were closed in a fist.

Then, a dark dagger, thirsty for murder appeared in my hand. I could hear it screaming inside my mind for blood.

OR\'ATH:

"Kill him. In any way you desire."

I gulp down.

F "Kill him...?"

OR\'ATH:

"You heard me."

F (I get to kill this monster?)

OR\'ATH:

"What will you do first?"

F "\...His dick."

OR\'ATH:

"Wonderful choice! Go ahead. I'll restrain him."

I approached the man who was sound asleep on his bed and carefully pulled his pants off, revealing his penis.

F (I feel like throwing up...)

F (I just have to stick this dagger in and take it out, right?)

In a swift motion, I plunged the dagger into his crotch, causing the blood to gush all over me.

\*sound of blood spurt and metal slash\*

The man immediately woke up and screamed his lungs out.

THALION:

T "ARGHHH!!!! WHAT THE-!!! YOU BITCH!!!"

\[blur background\]

Something took over me at that moment and my arm began moving on its own, piercing his chest, in and out, erratically, aggressively, fast, with no intention of calming down.

My lips curled upward and this moment felt like the first time I was feeling genuine pleasure.

I want to...

### 1) CHOOSE:

A. Embrace this feeling.

B. Stop myself. This feels wrong.

A\) Embrace this feeling.

I want him to taste my rage.

\[insert cg of fhaerta\]

Stab, stab, stab, stab, stab, stab, stab.

Countless times.

I couldn't wipe the smile off my face. It felt so good watching the blood splurt everywhere.

...Eventually, my arms went numb and the sound of the dagger hitting the ground echoed in the room.

I was gasping for air, laughing with tears running down my cheeks.

My sight was filled with blood and gore, his corpse all disjointed with his organs splattered around, my hands, arms, clothes...all tainted red.

F "\*sniff\* It's \*hiccup\* over..."

The devil who had witnessed the entire scene began laughing in amusement.

OR\'ATH:

"Well done, dear! You were amazing. I admit I couldn't have done it better."

B\) Stop myself. This feels wrong.

There was just a bloodied and unrecognisable corpse in front of me. He was gone already. I don't need to continue this.

I drop down the sword and let out a deep, long sigh.

F "It's done."

OR\'ATH: **

"Indeed. Well done, dear. Though, it wouldn't have been a problem to have let yourself enjoy this moment a little more."

He walked over to my side and glanced at the corpse on the bed.

OR\'ATH:

"\...That was well deserved."

He collects the dagger and licks off the blood from the blade.

OR\'ATH:

"Since our job here is done, what do you want to do now? The dagger is still at your mercy, if you wish to use it for, you know..."

OR\'ATH:

"Or perhaps, do you wish to bury this pile of meat first?"

F "\...I'm hungry."

OR\'ATH:

"Hmm. Very well, we shall have a delicious meal then. But before that, let me claim what is mine."

With a dark aura emanating from his hand, he drains the soul out of the corpse and absorbs it.

\*sound of magic absorption\*

F (No revival nor resurrection for him anymore.)

\[fade to black\]

...

\[BG The Crimson Room\]

Once again, I was brought to that same room from before.

The devil made me have another bath and change into the white robe I had on so I could sit on the bed.

After that, he sat on an extravagant armchair reading and signing a pile of papers a demon had brought him while I was bathing.

There was a knock at the door and a demon in butler attire came in with a long table and on top, various silver plates filled with all kinds of food.

OR\'ATH:

"Eat all you want."

I wanted to refuse, but the smell of everything that was on the table won over my strength and rationality. I end up devouring every dish like a wild creature.

F (Why is he doing all of that? Is this his method? Pampering his victims first before he kills them? Or is this his way of making me feel like I owe him...?)

F (\...Oh.)

F (I think I understand it now.)

After I was done eating and drinking all the wine, I glanced at him who was still occupied with the papers, although the pile had decreased significantly.

I get out of the bed and kneel down before him, moving my head closer to his crotch.

OR\'ATH:

"Wha- Oh. So now you're feeling like repaying for my kind hospitality. How earnest."

He puts the paper aside and brushes the hair out of my face.

OR\'ATH:

"Go on."

The skin of his cock was scaly and rough and the abnormity began twitching in front of my eyes, doubling in size.

F (There's no way this thing will fit inside my mouth...)

I start licking it from the base and up, covering it with my saliva and wrapping my mouth around the head.

I looked at him who kept staring intently at me while holding the hair out of my face.

F (He looks kinda annoyed... Is this not good?)

Then, he pulls my head away abruptly.

OR\'ATH:

"\...That's enough. Go rest. I still have work to finish."

F "\...Your Majesty... Why don't you kill me? Shouldn\'t this be a piece of cake to you?"

OR\'ATH:

"I'll kill you when I wish to do so. If you're still not satisfied, you're free to drown yourself in that bathtub."

F (Drown myself...?)

F (Yeah... Maybe...)

F (Even if he's already dead and I'm free to go, it's not like I would ever be able to function like a normal person anymore.)

F (I don't know how to do anything. I can't cook. I can't hunt. I can't write. I can't read. I'm a hopeless shit.)

F (I would end up being just another slave again...)

I stand up by the bathtub and stare down at the water.

\[insert pic of the bathtub with water\]

F (I have to sit, lie down...)

F (It's cold.)

F (How do I do it? Do I need to hold my breath? Gulp down the water?)

F (\...)

F (I can't...)

F (Is the devil magically restraining me?)

\[show orath sprite\]

F (No... He's just flipping through pages of paper. I can move just fine.)

F (It's me. I'm the one who can't bring myself to do it.)

F (I'm truly hopeless. No courage to take my own life, no will to live.)

I try my best to hold in the tears forming at the corner of my eyes.

F (Stop. Crying! Damn it!!!)

I fail at holding a sniff in and fall apart in tears.

F "\*sniff\*"

OR\'ATH:

"\...What a coward."

He crouched down next to me and dragged me out by the arm.

F "I'm sorry- \*sniff\*! I'm useless... \*weep\*"

OR\'ATH:

"Although it was cowardly of you to go back on what you started, it is also an honourable decision to keep on living."

OR\'ATH:

"Either way, well done. Looks like you're not that eager to die after all."

OR\'ATH:

"I wonder what I'll do with you. As you said, you're pretty useless to me. From your memories, you're not even literate so I can't give books for you to entertain yourself. You're being a nuisance."

F "\*hic\* S-Sorry."

OR\'ATH:

"\*sigh\* What do you like to do?"

F "I...\*hic\* I don't know."

OR\'ATH:

"Awesome. Just the answer I was expecting. \*sigh\* ...You know what? You should learn how to read. I'll have a slave teach you."

The devil summons a demon in formal attire holding a suitcase and a mini blackboard.

OR\'ATH:

"You better learn how to read decently in one month or else I'm dropping you somewhere in the peripheries of the above."

I wipe my tears and rub the snot out of my nose.

F "I'll-! I'll study hard."

OR\'ATH:

"Clean yourself. And change your clothes too. Show your new teacher some respect."

He turns his back to me and leaves.

F (I don't understand him at all.)

I dried myself with a towel and changed into a silk gown I found inside the closet.

The demon ahems and adjusts his glasses.

DEMON TEACHER:

"Pay attention."

He gives me an empty notebook, a pencil and picks up a bunch of flashcards with coloured pictures.

DEMON TEACHER:

"This is the first letter you will learn. We use it to write the word 'devil'. Memorise it."

F "Yes, sir."

Just like that, I started studying everyday and progressing very fast. At least once per day, the devil would come check on me, but he wouldn\'t say much and would leave rather quickly.

\[time skip, fade to black\]

...

F "Mr. Demon, what's written here? Is it 'acknowledged'?"

I showed him a word in a book he asked me to read out loud.

DEMON TEACHER:

"Yes, you read it correctly."

F "Great!"

F "Hey, Mr. Demon, since today is your last day teaching me, I wrote you a thank you letter. Here. My handwriting is a little wobbly, but I made sure everything was correct!"

The demon adjusted his glasses and took the letter from my hands.

DEMON TEACHER:

"Hmm... Indeed. It's a perfect letter. There are no mistakes."

F "Yes! It was all thanks to your guidance!"

F "Also... Would you teach me how to say something in Infernal?"

\[time skip, fade to black\]

## CHAPTER 3

\[BG: Or'ath's castle -- Throne hall\]

I walk slowly through the huge hall of the castle where his throne lies at the far end of it. He was sitting in a pretty laid back position, resting his head on his hand.

OR\'ATH:

"You're aware of what will happen in case you fail, I assume?"

F "Yes."

OR\'ATH:

"Hm. Read me the first chapter of this book. "

He throws a dusty book in my direction and I catch it clumsily.

F (I don't know this title. But I'll do just fine! Mr. Demon said so.)

I open the book and flip the first few pages till I reach the first chapter.

I take a deep breath.

F "Chapter one."

I begin reading.

Line after line, I'm having no trouble pronouncing any word. Somehow, a certain pride grew inside me at every paragraph I finished.

Till...

I'm still reading and I catch a word in the next line I've never seen before and have no idea what it means nor how to pronounce it.

I guessed the pronunciation, hoping it was right, and continued reading.

OR\'ATH:

"Stop there. Repeat the last paragraph."

F (Oh, no. He noticed.)

Trying to hide my nervousness, I do as he said.

This time, I decide...

### 2) CHOOSE:

A. to change the pronunciation.

B. not to change the pronunciation.

A\) to change the pronunciation.

F (I think I pronounced the last syllable wrong, so I'll read it differently.)

I go through the paragraph again.

OR\'ATH:

"Hold on there. You read that word differently than before. Why did you do that?"

F "I... I thought that I read it wrong because you asked me to read it again."

OR\'ATH:

"No. I just wanted to hear you read that part again."

OR\'ATH:

"\...So you were unsure of how to pronounce it, hm?"

F (I'm done for.)

He frowned his brows and thought for a few seconds.

OR\'ATH:

"But I won't pick on you because of a single word. Continue reading."

He leaned back against the cushion of his throne and motioned with his hand for me to continue.

I reached the end of the chapter with no problems after that and closed the book.

OR\'ATH:

"You did great. I'm proud of your hard work."

F "T-Thank you (Infernal)."

OR\'ATH:

"Oh. You went out of your way to learn something in my language?"

A smile grew on his face.

OR\'ATH:

"Very interesting. Expect a reward later. You're dismissed."

As soon as he finishes that sentence, two demons accompany me outside the hall and back to that bedroom.

B\) not to change the pronunciation.

F (I'm still unsure, but I don't want to show my uncertainty so I'll read it the same way as before.)

I keep on reading till the end of the chapter. After that paragraph, there was no interruption and he remained very calm, listening to me with his eyes closed.

I exhaled the air I was holding in when I enunciated the last word.

OR\'ATH:

"\...Very good. Come here."

I close the book and head towards the throne, lowering my head in respect.

As soon as I did that, he gently caressed the top of my head.

OR\'ATH: **

"You did an excellent job. What a very good girl... I'm proud of what you accomplished."

F "T-Thank you. (spoken in Infernal)"

OR\'ATH:

"Hah! As if you couldn't surprise me any more, you learned a word in my language. I shall give you a nice reward later."

F (Somehow, it makes me happy to be praised by him.)

The devil tucks a few hair strands behind my ear and pats my head once again. Then, he states something in Infernal and two demons accompany me outside the hall and back to that bedroom.

\[BG: The Crimson Room\]

\*door shut sound\*

F "Phew! What a relief! I managed to do this!"

F "I feel so happy knowing that I can read any book now! And write! I could even get a job somehow if I go-"

F (-back.)

F (\...)

F (There's no way I would be able to go back. He wouldn't be so dumb as to let me leave. Even if I have no actual heart I still have a soul he could absorb.)

F (And...)

F (I also...don't want to leave.)

F (It's weird. I'm supposed to hate this place. But everyday I can sleep without interruptions, I can have warm baths, delicious food and...he doesn't assault me.)

F (I have no idea of how long I've spent here, but I already feel attached.)

F (I think I'll write about today in my diary.)

F (Mr. Demon gave me this pocket notebook so I could start practising my writing skills.)

F (In the first pages my handwriting is so ugly. I've really improved a lot.)

F (These days I've been feeling strangely happy... I wonder if I'm allowed to have these feelings.)

...

F (I'm bored...)

F (I have no idea about the passage of time in this place...)

F (There's no day or night, it's always dark red and the moon up there, if it is a moon, doesn't move at all.)

I try to entertain myself by tidying up the room and organising the scattered books on the shelves.

F (Should I organise them in alphabetical order? Or by colour?)

...

I lie down on the bed.

F "Phew! I'm done. It's all nice and clean here now. I want to show him and see what he says!"

F "I wonder when he will come..."

The door opens.

\*door creaking sound\*

F (It's him!)

I turn around in an instant, but find a demon in butler's clothes with a tray on his hand.

F (Oh. It's dinner time.)

I pick up the tray and thank him.

F (\...Every demon here has a specific clothing, although I'm not sure it's necessary... I guess he likes dressing up his subjects?)

F (Also, they are very obedient and tame, almost as if they\'re domesticated.)

He stands by the door, watching over me while I eat.

Not too long after dinner, the door opens again and this time-

F "Your Majesty!"

I stand up to greet him at the door.

OR\'ATH:

"Seems like someone was excited to see me. That's certainly unusual."

F "Um..."

OR\'ATH:

"Is it because I told you there would be a reward?"

F "No! I wasn't thinking about the reward, I just wanted to see-!"

OR\'ATH:

"-Me?"

I look down and nod in embarrassment.

The devil lets out a laugh.

OR\'ATH:

"Are you a puppy?"

OR\'ATH:

Waiting for me to come... Wanting to see me..."

He brushes the hair of my face and tucks it behind my ear.

OR\'ATH:

"My puppy\..."

His eyes glowed as he said these words with a grin.

OR\'ATH:

"Let us talk about your reward."

OR\'ATH:

"I know that women like to indulge in vanity... and I assume you weren't so lucky as to have been able to enjoy this benefit."

OR\'ATH:

"Therefore, because you have been a very obedient girl, I decided to reward you with these gifts."

He looks to the door in which a few demons dressed in suits come from holding various dresses, jewellery, accessories and shoes. They leave soon after placing them all on top of the bed.

F (By the Hells!)

OR\'ATH:

"You may try and choose the pieces you like the most and keep them for yourself."

OR\'ATH:

"However! Before that, you need some grooming. Let's have your hair, nails and some makeup done."

He snaps his finger and a stylish demon appears along with a mirror and a hydraulic chair.

OR\'ATH:

"Sit there and let my servant do its thing. While I'll sit here and get some work done."

The demon began brushing my hair and dividing it into sections.

F (Even though it has claws, it doesn't scratch me and it actually feels so nice having my hair brushed\...)

...

F "Whoa..."

I look at the figure in front of the mirror and struggle to recognise it as myself.

\[insert cg of her looking at the mirror with the dress on and Or'ath behind her\]

(description: My hair was shiny and tied in a half bun decorated with golden flower hair pins. My nails were painted a glossy red.

My face looked plump and alive. There was glitter on my eyelids, my cheeks pink and my lips a cherry red. Green dress with gold.)

F (I look so...beautiful.)

OR\'ATH:

"Enjoying what you see?"

The devil approached from behind and put his hand on my shoulder.

F "Yes! Very much! Thank you for this, your Majesty!"

OR\'ATH:

"Let's go for a walk. I want all my servants to see you."

\[BG: Or'ath's castle -- Throne hall\]

He takes my hand and brings me through the long halls of his castle.

Everything is so extravagant and luxurious. I bet not even the wealthiest up there could measure up to this...

We reach a balcony at the highest floor of the tower in this castle.

\[BG: Or'ath's kingdom\]

F "The view...it's stunning!"

F (We're so high. I can see everything. A bunch of demons and fiends flying everywhere, lava flowing down like waterfalls, buildings forming enormous cities and many bridges.)

OR\'ATH:

"Indeed it is. It's all mine after all."

F "All yours?!"

OR\'ATH:

"You're in my kingdom, dear. I thought you knew."

F "I... I had no idea. I just kinda knew you were something like a king, but, not that you ruled...all of this."

OR\'ATH:

"It's certainly a blessing to be this ignorant. Cute, even."

F (Ignorant and cute...? Was this a compliment?)

OR\'ATH:

"\...Hold on tight."

F "What-EEK??!!!!!"

The devil grabbed me by the waist and lifted me up abruptly, spreading his wings open.

F "Y-YOU CAN FLY?!"

OR\'ATH:

"You thought these wings were solely for decoration? And quit yelling. Show some respect."

F "Sorry."

OR\'ATH:

"I'll show you my kingdom from up close. Enjoy the view."

We flew across the cities and through the highest towers. Then, to the mountains of magma and lava falls.

I kept holding on super tightly to him the entire time.

Sometimes, a few fiends would get on his way, but he would blow them up instantly with a giant fireball.

F (So scary...and powerful.)

...

OR\'ATH:

"And we're back."

He landed us on that same balcony.

F "That...was amazing. And a little scary. I thought I was gonna fall in the lava."

OR\'ATH:

"That would have never happened."

F "Um, *thank you*, your Majesty. I had fun."

OR'ATH;

"Heh. It's dangerous for you to speak my language."

F "Why? I thought it was right for me to learn it, since I'm basically living here."

OR\'ATH:

"Indeed, you're not wrong."

OR\'ATH:

"But it makes me want to ravish and devour you from the inside. I shouldn't do that to my puppy."

F "\...I...I've already been corrupted for way too long."

F "I... Maybe I...wouldn't mind being devoured by you in the end. To be honest, I don't know why you've allowed me to live for so long."

OR\'ATH:

"I wonder about that too. Something in me couldn't bring myself to kill you. You just looked so hopeless, like an abandoned and traumatised pooch."

OR\'ATH:

"I was curious to see what you would look like if you experienced happiness."

F "If I experienced happiness..."

F (That's right. Ever since I was brought here, I was able to see sides of myself unknown to me. Feelings like pride, joy, satisfaction, comfort...)

F (And he was the one responsible for this. A devil. Of every living being in this world.)

F (I don't care whatever his evil motives or intentions are. I will die happily by his hands.)

I placed my hand on his chest and looked at his captivating radiant eyes.

F "I want you. And this time, I ask you to take my life when you've become bored of playing with me. Till then, please, cherish this puppy of yours."

He licked his pointy teeth.

OR\'ATH:

"With pleasure."

...

\[BG: The Crimson Room\]

For the first time in all my life, I was feeling pleasure in intercourse.

Every place his skin touched on mine was gentle, careful and burning hot.

Nothing violent or rash.

I was feeling...cared for.

F "\*giggle\* that tickles!"

OR\'ATH:

"Do you like it?"

He whispers in my ear, licking my lobe.

F "Mm... It feels good..."

He pushes his knees forward, grabbing my thigh and pulling it to the side.

F "\...Be gentle...please."

OR\'ATH:

"You forget my nature."

F "If this is part of your nature, it's my first time being treated with such thoughtfulness...Nn, wait-"

OR\'ATH:

"It's truly a shame you don't know what pure kindness is."

F "\...It's alright. The one you've shown me till now is enough. Ha... It's what I deserve in this lifetime."

F "Who knows. Maybe in my next reincarnation I can have a kinder and warmer life."

F "It's just a little sad that we will probably not meet."

OR\'ATH:

"Surely, if you were to know kindness and healthy love, we wouldn't meet. And if we did, you would despise me. You're supposed to hate and fear me."

OR\'ATH:

"But fate has its intricate ways. And you are a very weird, unfortunate woman."

OR\'ATH:

"\...Well, that's enough chit-chat for now. Let's not kill this mood."

The next second I was pierced with a sudden burst of pleasure burning me deep inside.

F "Your... Majesty-!! Ah!"

Scalding hot, ferocious, vicious.

I clung on to his back, letting my mouth run loose. He held me tightly, with his head buried in my neck.

\[insert cg\]

OR\'ATH:

"Say...Say my name-"

He groaned in my ear.

F "Mn! O...Or'ath-!!"

OR\'ATH:

"It's...*Or'ath.* Say it correctly."

F "I-I can't!! Ngh...!! Or'ath! Or'ath, Or'ath-"

OR\'ATH:

"Still wrong."

OR\'ATH:

"I guess it's unfair for me to expect you to say it right at this moment. For now, show me what you can do."

He stopped moving and sat back, adjusting our position so I was on top of him.

He leaned back leisurely, brushing his hair back.

F (I... He wants me to ride him?)

I laid my hands on his stomach and began moving my hips back and forth, gradually increasing speed.

OR\'ATH:

"What a godly sight..."

He was panting and groaning, but he wouldn't take his eyes off me.

F (It\'s embarrassing having him stare so hard...but this feels so good...!)

F "Am I...doing alright, Or'ath?"

OR\'ATH:

"You're great..."

Then, he grabbed my butt cheeks sinking his claws on my skin, and lifted me up a little-

F "Eek!? Or'ath?!"

-and plunged me down into his crotch.

F "Ngh-!!!"

An electrifying jolt went through my whole body. Before I could think, he pulled up my hips again and kept thrusting me against him nonstop.

F "O-Or'ath-! Or- Wait...! Ah, ah!!! Or'ath!!! I, I- Too..deep!!"

OR\'ATH:

"\*huff\* Are you feeling good...?"

F "Y-yes...!!!"

OR\'ATH:

"Want me to stop?"

F "Ngh...That's...! Mn, no..."

\[Fade to black\]

...

F "Why did you stop me that time I tried to go down on you?"

I snuggle in the sheets, sneaking closer to him.

We had just cleaned ourselves from the sweat and now we were cuddling in his bed. My body was sore and there were red marks everywhere where he had touched me.

OR\'ATH:

"Because I was disgusted."

F "Disgusted!?"

OR\'ATH:

"You were doing that because it was what you were conditioned to do."

OR\'ATH:

"I get pleasure from watching my victim tremble in fear, anger, reluctance, even yearning. There was nothing in that face of yours."

F "Oh... I see. Did I have that look on my face when we were doing it?"

OR\'ATH:

"No. On the contrary, the face you were making was the best you could ever imagine."

He cups my cheeks in his hand and shows me a soft smile.

OR\'ATH:

"You were smiling."

OR\'ATH:

"And so cute when trying to say my name."

F "You're mean."

OR\'ATH:

"Just realised?"

\[fade to black\]

### EXTRA in case the past choices have been 1.A 2.B

F "\*huff\*\...Ah, ah...! \*pant\* I can't-"

OR\'ATH:

"Beg for it."

F "O-Or'ath, please!"

OR\'ATH:

"Too bad. You pronounced it wrong again."

F "I, I can't- focus! This is too...much!!"

I was hanging in the air, being held by black rubbery tentacles and touched everywhere by mage hands.

The hands wouldn't let me rest and kept tickling and exploring all my orifices. My body was covered in black goo from the tentacles that were wrapped against my limbs and spreading me apart.

This was his punishment after I wasn't able to complete the book quota he set for me. I had to read 20 books in the span of three months and write a summary for each. I did 19.

F "\...I'm- sorry!"

F "Or'ath, I beg you!!"

F "Ah, I... I don't want this- I want to be touched only by you!"

F "Please...!"

I pleaded to him with teary eyes.

OR\'ATH:

"I guess it can't be helped if you put it like this. Very well."

He swirled his hands, making everything disappear. Just as I was about to hit the floor, he caught me mid air.

OR\'ATH:

"There, there. You can stop crying now."

He holds me closer and rubs the tears from my cheeks.

OR\'ATH:

"It seems I'm not that rigorous of an owner."

F "\...*Or'ath*."

OR\'ATH:

"Oh. That was correct. Maybe my methods do work after all."

He kisses my forehead and then my mouth.

OR\'ATH:

"Let's put you to rest a little, my love."

F "I'm not tired? It was just, overstimulating. But...I'm fine."

OR\'ATH:

"\...You don't seem to understand what this implies to me."

F "I, I know what I said. I told you I wanted to be touched by you only."

I clung on higher, putting my hands on his shoulder and bringing my face to his ear.

I whisper.

F Please, *Or'ath*. I want to be punished by *you*.

OR\'ATH:

You're a very naughty pooch.

## CHAPTER 4 -- TIME SKIP

\[BG: Or'ath's bedroom\]

I take a brush from the drawer and begin brushing my hair.

F "My hair has grown a lot..."

I stare at myself reflected in the mirror of the dressing table. I had just woken up and still had a sleeping gown on.

F (Years have passed ever since I came here. Or'ath and I got married. I became queen, learned to speak Infernal and have been living every day comfortably.)

F (Or'ath is still the same: ruthless, strict, cunning, terrifying...but...also a loving, thoughtful F and caring partner. Things which you would never think a devil could be.)

A hand touches my shoulder.

OR\'ATH:

"Allow me to do it, my love."

F "*Or'ath*, you woke up."

We give each other a kiss and I hand him my brush.

F (Or'ath is always so gentle with my hair...)

OR\'ATH:

"Want me to braid it?"

F "Yes, please."

He took a section of my hair, divided it into three strands and began braiding it, adding more hair as he went. Then, he tied the ends with a ribbon.

OR\'ATH:

"Let me decorate with these flower pins\..."

\[insert cg of her sat in front of the mirror and him placing a flower pin\]

F "It's looking beautiful."

OR\'ATH:

"It's because you are beautiful, my love. And I'm sure our child thinks the same."

He gives me a soft smile, placing his hand on my round belly.

I look at him, caressing his cheek.

F "I love you, *Or'ath*."

OR\'ATH:

"And I love you, Fhaerta."

F "Ouch! It kicked me."

OR'ATH

"\...I dislike the fact that I can't punish my own offspring for hurting you."

F "\*giggle\* You can't say that, dear!"

OR\'ATH:

"I will make sure it learns not to anger his father soon after being born."

F "Remember it will be only a baby. It won't understand you."

OR\'ATH:

"Then I'll think of a way so it can."

F "\*chuckle\* Well, it must be due soon. I can feel it's a very big child. I wonder who they'll take after."

OR\'ATH:

"I hope it's me so it will learn faster how to treat its mother right. If it takes after you I will have a harder time since you're a very slow learner."

F "You're still going on about- hey, I'm not a slow learner!"

OR\'ATH:

"Sure, sure. Let's go eat."

He wraps his hand around me and lifts me up.

F "Wait! I still haven't changed!"

OR\'ATH:

"It's fine. I will take it off soon anyway. I plan to bathe you after our meal."

F "Oh. Thank you."

...

After our meal and bath, Or'ath brought us to the bedroom.

We laid by each other's side to cuddle.

OR\'ATH:

"Did it kick you any more?"

F "Not at all."

OR\'ATH:

"Great. I should reward it with a gentle pat then."

Or'ath reached under my dress and caressed my belly.

I looked at him, who had a soft smile on his face, and kissed his cheek.

F "\...If it's a boy, its name will be *Or'ath*."

OR\'ATH:

"A perfect choice. No other name could be a better fit."

OR\'ATH:

"Well then, it shall be *Fhaerta*, in case it's a girl."

We stare at each other's eyes for a while before giving in to a long kiss.

F "I wish we could stay every day like this."

OR\'ATH:

"Surprisingly, I would not be against it."

F "\...Thank you. For showing me happiness."

...

The day of birth.

OR\'ATH:

"FHAERTA!!! FHAERTA, MY LOVE!!! CAN YOU HEAR ME?!?!"

OR\'ATH:

"SAY SOMETHING!!!"

The whining and crying of a baby.

DEMON SECRETARY:

"M-My king, the queen is-"

OR\'ATH:

"I KNOW! I KNOW! I KNEW THIS COULD HAPPEN AND YET I-"

OR\'ATH:

"\...If only I had been more cautious. I was so...on cloud nine, I\..."

OR\'ATH:

"It completely escaped me the fact that devil offspring could absorb their birth giver\'s souls."

OR\'ATH:

"I could have created a replica of her soul..."

OR\'ATH:

"Oh! Fhaerta, my dearest! To think a devil like me could still feel grief-!"

OR\'ATH:

"I let myself love you too much..."

DEMON SECRETARY:

"\...My king. Forgive my rudeness but, what do we do with the baby?"

OR\'ATH:

"Baby?"

OR\'ATH:

"\..."

OR\'ATH:

"Kill it."

DEMON SECRETARY:

"My king-"

OR\'ATH:

"No... I would come to regret that."

OR\'ATH:

"This creature... It killed her, but it's proof of our love and her happiness."

OR\'ATH:

"However, I can't face it. It looks too much like her and this...pains my heart."

DEMON SECRETARY:

"Then, what should we do, my king?"

OR\'ATH:

"\...Raise it among you servants. Teach it the ways of our hell. But, don't let it come close to me, for whatever reason unless deemed necessary."

OR\'ATH:

"I will appoint you as its guardian until it reaches maturity. Can I entrust you with this duty?"

DEMON SECRETARY

"It shall be done, my king."

OR\'ATH:

"Now, leave me alongside my love for a while."

DEMON SECRETARY:

"Understood."

OR\'ATH:

"Fhaerta... The best of wives. My biggest love. My biggest weakness."

OR\'ATH:

"How come I, the most intelligent, powerful sorcerer, failed to foresee this event? ...It should have been impossible."

OR\'ATH:

"I wonder if this had your touch, oh, mighty ruler of Tartarum. For I, a devil general, must not have any weaknesses."
