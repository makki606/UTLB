# SOCIETY & RACES
Although each community has its own culture, traditions and rules, society is divided by a Caste System. The races and species are classified according to their lifespan, individual power and intelligence.

Below is the ranking of some races not in order (may change in the future):



**HIGH RANK**
  - Deities
  - Archdevil
  - Devils
  - Angels
  - Unicorns
  - Dragons
  - Demigods
  - Elves and Drows
  - Vampires
  - Demons
  - Aasimar

**MID RANK**
  - Tieflings
  - Satyrs
  -  Centaurs  
  - Humans
  - Werebeasts (animal or beast hybrids) *may vary*
  - Halflings
  - Gnomes 
  - Mermaids
  - Giants
  - Fairies
  - Dwarves

**LOW RANK**
  - Nymphs
  - Orcs
  - Kobolds
  - Ogres
  - Goblins
  - Undead (Zombies, ghosts, mummies)


While the higher ranks are admired or feared, the lower ones tend to be looked down upon or pitied. The Undead usually live as outcasts or isolated in suburbs or slums.

Currently, the caste system doesn’t hold that much importance to the majority of folk, who prefer to live in harmony without being prejudiced, however, the conservative or the wealthy still care for and try to reinforce the ranking system. 

Next is some info of some races + my headcanons:

## DEITY/GOD
Extremely powerful magical beings, capable of pretty much everything as long as they specialize in it. Sempiternal, immortal beings. The only way to kill a deity is if all their worshippers cease to exist. Most of Addamah believes in the existence of deities with each community having a specific deity (or more) to serve, follow or celebrate. So, as long as religious people continue to exist, deities will too.

**Gods have 3 eyes or more and they can appear anywhere on their body.** The amount of eyes is proportional to their power, though, that’s not always true. They can assume whichever from/shape they wish. Their true form is actually inexistent since their life depends on the belief/faith of beings in Addamah. 

Deities can possess whichever thing or living being they wish and not disturb the soul inside the body about to be possessed for a while (unlike demons who rob the soul or devour it). If they wish to take full possession of a certain body, they don’t need to seal any contract and can just absorb the soul. However, that’s a forbidden act by the Supreme Celestial Court and the deity will be severely punished. A soul possession is a very heavy toll on an Addamah living being’s body, so very few survive if not aided.


## DEVILS / DEMONS
Chaotic, evil, carefree, narcissistic, possessive, greedy and manipulators. Very few are good-aligned or carry positive traits. Like angels and deities, they can also assume whichever shapes they want. Their true form can only be seen by Celestial or Infernal beings, although, they can be felt if they touch an Addamah living being. They are described as a freezing or scalding hot fog. Also, basically immortal, unless if eaten by a more powerful Infernal being or annihilated by a deity/angel.

Demons/Devils can enter in Addamah, however, they can’t touch or feel anything in their true form, **except for the Archdevil and some of the Devil generals**. In order to step in Addamah materially, they need to be summoned or to seal a soul contract with something/someone that lives there and possess their body. In a soul contract, the contractant will become the demon/devil’s gate from Tartarum to Addamah. It’s usually a one time thing: if the demon/devil returns to Tartarum after they’ve possessed a body (the contractant dies after), they will need to seal another contract next time they wish to go to Addamah. That’s because they take the soul for themselves and absorb/devour it. But for **devils**, one way to solve this is to seal a heavier contract which is to make an Addamah being their permanent gate by taking full possession of the contractant’s soul instead of absorbing/devouring it. With this, they can come and go whenever they like. This contract is called **SOUL BINDING**, also referred to as “marriage” by devils. However, they can only accomplish this contract if they have full consent of the contractant and they can’t be tricked into a Soul Bind unlike the many other soul contracts. The Archdevil and some of the devil officers don’t need to do that.

**Difference between demons and devils:** 
Demons can’t be reasoned with. They are beasts made of pure hatred and destruction, and many are used by devils as soldiers and slaves. They have no rules and are usually summoned for battles.
Devils are intelligent, rational beings. They have laws, rules, values and a society/hierarchy. They like to exploit, manipulate and do things for their own benefit. They are still evil, but can be pragmatic and even do good deeds as long as they get something in return. 


## ANGEL
Creatures of Caelum. They are born in the skies and will die, if they do, in the skies. They are considered immortal beings. Magical, very powerful and gleam in light. They are warriors and assist/serve deities in their many duties such as protecting Caelum from possible invaders.

All angels are born blind. Appearance wise, they will usually have something covering their eyes or restraining their sight. It can be a piece of cloth, feathers, horns, sewn eyes anything. This is a trait that represents justice and lack of prejudice.


## SATYR
Horny alcoholics 24/7. They need alcohol (usually wine) to survive, like water to most creatures.

They usually live in the woods, alone or in groups of 2-3 among other creatures’ communities. They have the ability to speak to animals.
