# GEOGRAPHY

The world of Lunætta is divided in 3 main Planes of Existence:

    • ADDAMAH 
    • CAELUM
    • TARTARUM

Other planes are: the DREAMWORLD and the EDEN.

Addamah stands in the centre of the universe surrounded by Caelum (above) and Tartarum (below). Eden is a smaller plane between Caelum and Addamah. The whole universe looks like an Yggdrasil Tree. There are also the Soul Currents which connects the PLanes of Existence.

Caelum sends souls to Addamah and Tartarum (Reincarnation and absolute death, respectively). 

Eden sends the newborn souls to Addamah

Addamah sends souls to Caelum (Purgatory)


## ADDAMAH

Brown theme

It’s the Material Plane and basically, the Earth or Overworld. It’s the land of all mortal life and matter. I have yet to create a map to illustrate it. It stands in the centre of all Planes. I consider it infinite and full of possibilities.

Every living being, creature, whatever the fuck can enter in this plane if there are no circumstances unabling it to. 

## CAELUM

Light blue and yellow theme

The Celestial plane, Heaven, the skies, paradise etc
Home of all deities, angels, unicorns and Celestial beings. 

An unreachable place to normies.

The plane of Order, purity and justice.

This is the plane where the souls of mortal lives are sent to trial in order to decide their fate. After a mortal being dies in Addamah, its soul is immediately brought/sent to Caelum. There, the Celestial Courts will decide if the soul: 
    1. gets to rest and wait for its next reincarnation;
    2. is too wicked, evil or restless for a reincarnation and sent to Tartarum, where it can end up becoming an Infernal being or devoured by them, or even a lost/stray soul (exceptionally rare)
    3. is too old to withstand a reincarnation so it just rests there till its lifespan ends so it, now a shell, can get sent to Tartarum to be absorbed by the Archdevil (the grave of the dead).

Celestial Courts are responsible for maintaining the order and justice in Caelum, and if necessary, interfere in Addamah. Their main function is to review and judge the souls that come to Caelum, and  administrate the Plane of the skies. The Court is formed by authority figures such as higher deities/gods or angels, specially deities of justice.

There is also the Celestial Supreme Court, the highest judicial court in Caelum. They are the final arbiter of the laws of Lunætta. The Supreme Court is only summoned in extreme or important cases such as matters involving deities or angels. For example, they have the power to banish angels from Caelum, punish deities, imprison them, persecute enemies etc.

## TARTARUM

Red and black theme
The Underworld, Hell, Gehenna, the Abyss etc.
Home of demons, hell hounds, the Devil and all Infernal beings.
Another unreachable place to normies. 

The plane of Chaos, evil and darkness.

The Archdevil is the king and ruler of Tartarum and it employs powerful devil officers to make ruling easier, they end up doing all the work though. His main job is to absorb shells of dead souls, hence why he’s called the Grave of the Dead. He’s the most comprehensible of all Infernal beings as long as Caelum continues to feed him souls and their shells.

Tartarum is infinite and the most developed regions are the ones that surround the “main” kingdom of the Archdevil (he is said to be everywhere all at once, omnipresent), these surrounding areas are divided into nations with each having their own ruler. Nothing much is known about the peripheries, besides them being filled with Infernal matter, demons, all kinds of fiends and disorder.


There are 13 nations that surround the centre of Tartarum, they are called the “13 Abaddons”. Each Abaddon is ruled by a Devil Officer, usually addressed as “generals of Tartarum”. They are extremely powerful and intelligent/rational devils that would only lose to the Archdevil himself in a hypothetical fight, and even if they all joined forces to oppose the Archdevil, they wouldn’t be able to defeat him. The generals usually don’t get along with each other but also they avoid engaging in fights and treat each other with minimum respect. 

## EDEN

Aka. The Great Garden of Eden. 

A smaller plane. This is the place where souls are born and cultivated. The deities of fertility are responsible for creating and taking care of newborn souls, they also employ young angels to help them. 

In the Great Garden, the souls are like flowers. They start off as seed which will grow into flowers and when it blooms, they will be fully formed souls ready to be sent and incarnated in Addamah. The deities’ main job is to ensure this process of cultivating souls is as perfect as possible and to correct any defects along the way, such as pruning, watering it etc

The deities of fertility can come in and go as they please, other Celestial beings aren’t allowed to step in unless given permission by a Celestial Court. Addamah and Tartarum are prohibited from stepping in this plane, and they can’t.


## DREAMWORLD

The world of dreams, only reachable through dreams ofc or Dreamers, Lucid dreamers. It doesn’t exist materially in any way.
