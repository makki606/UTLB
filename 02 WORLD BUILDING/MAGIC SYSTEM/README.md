# MAGIC SYSTEM

Magic isn’t accessible to everyone. 

Species born without magic have to learn it by spell casting and this is usually reserved for the wealthy or powerful. An alternative way would be to seal a contract with a devil and be sustained by them, but it’s not the most advisable decision.

Species who are born magical have to learn it since early unless their community forbiddens it for a specific reason.

There are also individuals who are born in mage lineages (mage blood), who can cast and manipulate magic, even if their species aren’t able to use it or see it.

The ones that use magic, specially when living in a continent/community with magicless species, they are obliged to carry documents (issued by the local government) approving of their use of magic and have consequences if used it in any evil ways.


## FORBIDDEN SPELLS by the Supreme Court (from most to least dangerous/costly):
    • Resurrection;
    • Soul Replication;
    • Immortality;
    • Soul Theft;
    • Soul Link;
    • Soul Possession by a Deity (not exactly a spell, but extremely advised against).
    • Memory Modification/Erasure of masses;

Besides from requiring immense amounts of mana to cast, these are spells that break or disturb the balance of life in Lunætta and therefore, using them are extremely forbidden and come with dangerous consequences. 

Few Celestial beings (angels and deities, for example) have the power of casting these spells, but would be heavily punished for doing so, it would mean corruption of the self. No deity/angel in their sane state of mind would dare or dream to use them.

Devils are free to cast these spells with little to no consequences, but, as known, they need to seal soul contracts to use them or immense amounts of mana/power, which many don’t have. The Archdevil and the 13 Generals use these spells on a frequent basis, but because they are aware of the balance of life, they charge expensively from their contractants.
