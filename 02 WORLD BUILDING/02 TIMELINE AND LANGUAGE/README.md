# TIMELINE

I wanted to create a universe where I wouldn’t be limited because of the time setting, so I decided to make it a big mixture. There are many continents in Lunætta, each continent has its own history and are in different phases of development regarding technology.
UTLB will happen in a continent where there isn’t modern technology, so no phones or Internet for example. It will be set in a time similar to the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in Europe. Cars are rare, many people use bicycles, carriages or other means of transportation. That doesn’t mean they don’t know modern technology, because “globalization”. Other continents have and use advanced technology, so some people have and use them. For example, Seleni has freezers and a fridge.

# LANGUAGE

Almost all living beings of Addamah can speak COMMON, of course, there are different accents, slang and regionalismos, but it’s essentially the same. They grow up speaking this language and it’s also a mandatory language in schools. Unless they were raised in isolated communities, conservatory groups or something along these lines, they won’t know how to speak it. 

Every species has their own language and dialects.

In Tartarum, Infernal beings speak INFERNAL, some creatures even forgot how to speak.

In Caelum, CELESTIAL is spoken by Celestial beings.
